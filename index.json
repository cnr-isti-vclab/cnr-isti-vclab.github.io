This feature significantly simplifies on-site assembly and also ensures compactness for efficient transport and storage. However, designing these structures still remains a challenge. This paper tackles the inverse design problem of alignable lamella gridshells leveraging concepts from differential geometry and Cartan’s theory of moving frames. The study unveils that geodesic alignable gridshells, where lamellae are disposed tangentially to the surface, are limited to forming shapes isometric to surfaces of revolution. Furthermore, it demonstrates that alignable gridshells with lamellae arranged orthogonally to a surface can be realized only on a specific class of surfaces that meet a particular curvature condition along their principal curvature lines. Finally, drawing on these theoretical findings, this work introduces novel computational tools tailored for the design of these structures.","tags":["Architectural Geometry","Digital Fabrication"],"title":"Alignable Lamella Gridshells","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We have had two papers at SIGGRAPH 2024.

Its extension to a more complex shape is still challenging, as a uniform distribution of sensing electrodes is required for consistent touch sensitivity across the surface. To overcome this problem, we propose a method to adapt the sensor layout of common capacitive multi-touch sensors to more complex 3D surfaces, ensuring high-resolution, robust multi-touch detection. The method automatically computes a grid of transmitter and receiver electrodes with as regular distribution as possible over a general 3D shape. It starts with the computation of a proxy geometry by quad meshing used to place the electrodes through the dual-edge graph. It then arranges electrodes on the surface to minimize the number of touch controllers required for capacitive sensing and the number of input/output pins to connect the electrodes with the controllers. We reach these objectives using a new simplification and clustering algorithm for a regular quad-patch layout. The reduced patch layout is used to optimize the routing of all the structures (surface grooves and internal pipes) needed to host all electrodes on the surface and inside the object's volume, considering the geometric constraints of the 3D shape. Finally, we print the 3D object prototype ready to be equipped with the electrodes. We analyze the performance of the proposed quad layout simplification and clustering algorithm using different quad meshing and characterize the signal quality and accuracy of the capacitive touch sensor for different non-planar geometries. The tested prototypes show precise and robust multi-touch detection with good Signal-to-Noise Ratio and spatial accuracy of about 1mm.","tags":["Geometry Processing","Rendering and Advanced UI"],"title":"Capacitive Touch Sensing on General 3D Surfaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We are happy to welcome two new members in the Visual Computing Lab: Dr. Erika Pistolesi and Dr. Quirino Saraceni.

We design a family of tileable and fabricable patterns represented as triangle meshes, which can be assembled for creating surface tessellations. First, a regular recursive subdivision of the planar space generates different geometric configurations for candidate patterns, having interesting and varied aesthetic properties. Then, a refinement step addresses manufacturability by solving for non-manifold configurations and sharp angles that would produce disconnected or weak patterns. We devise a strategy for creating continuous variations on the geometry of individual patterns, in both aesthetics and behavior, to enrich the catalog of available designs. Finally, we simulate our patterns to evaluate their mechanical response when loaded in different scenarios targeting out-of-plane bending. Through a simple browsing interface, we show that our patterns span a variety of different bending behaviors. The result is a catalog of patterns with varied aesthetics and predefined mechanical behavior, to use for the direct design of mechanical metamaterials.

By comparing archaeological data with experimental data, in parallel with the analysis of 3D models’ surfaces, it has been possible to better define the technique employed and quickly identify the type of tool used to create the ceramic decorations.

The central concept is to support the base network of elements with an additional layer of beams placed at a certain distance from the base surface. We exploit two main techniques to design these structures: first, we derive the orientation of the beam network on a given initial surface forming the grid shell to be reinforced; then, we compute the height of the additional layer that maximizes its overall structural performance. Our method includes a new formulation to derive a smooth direction field that orients the quad remeshing and a novel algorithm that iteratively optimizes the height of the additional layer to minimize the structure’s compliance. We couple our optimization strategy with a set of constraints to improve buildability of the network and, simultaneously, preserve the initial surface. We showcase our method on a significant dataset of shapes to demonstrate its applicability to cases where free-form grid shells do not exhibit adequate structural performance due to their geometry.","tags":["Architectural Geometry","Geometry Processing"],"title":"Bending-Reinforced Grid Shells for Free-form Architectural Surfaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Callieri"],"categories":[],"content":"OPUS - Open AI solutions for historical masonry annotation Understanding historical masonries in cultural heritage assets is a challenging task that involves different disciplinary fields and the work of experts. The annotation of historical masonry is a process of association between the graphically represented element and any relevant knowledge-based information. This autoptic analysis is vital for supporting the documentation, analysis and diagnosis of heritage structures. The conventional approach is based on the manual drawing of annotated regions over photos or orthographic images of the structure. This makes the process prohibitively time consuming and extremely costly, limiting the ability to manage large-scale monitoring. The OPUS project aims to develop and test an integrated AI-based system for the assisted and automatic annotation of historical masonries. The project will tackle the annotation task using both assisted AI-based tools and automated CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) semantic segmentation models, working at different levels and granularity: the mapping of construction features, namely techniques and materials, and the mapping of individual constituent elements. The aim will be reached through the use of TagLab, an open-source AI-powered semantic segmentation software developed by the project’s partners. This tool, originally designed to work on marine biology, will be extended to work on masonries and improved by tweaking and extending its functionalities. A key part of the project’s approach is to maintain the role of the expert pivotal. Our aim is not to create a novel process of masonry annotation, but to complement the current workflow with AI technology, able to support and facilitate the manual annotation, and to automate the large-scale tasks. The project will work on the theoretical aspects of the masonry annotation, formalizing the annotation process and mapping to an AI framework, defining the classes of interest and input data, and establishing integrated human-AI annotation workflows. From a methodological viewpoint, the project will promote a transdisciplinary approach to the study of historical masonry. From a technical viewpoint, the project will explore the use of AI technology in the cultural heritage field, developing practical solutions to open research issues: advanced user interface and interaction, use of multi-band data, improving the learning process on real-world data. The OPUS project will adopt a case study research approach, as it can generate an in-depth, multi-faceted understanding of masonries located in a geographical area, while mitigating challenges and complexities derived from the variety of local building cultures. The project will reach out to the community working on historical masonry (academic, public and private), distributing the produced datasets as open-data and the developed software as open source, organizing training workshops and dissemination events.\nBando PRIN 2022 Decreto Direttoriale n. 104 del 02-02-2022 Principal Investigator: Marco Callieri Codice progetto: 202277KJ8F Settore ERC: SH6 Durata: 24 mesi","date":1702252800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702252800,"objectID":"bda86555c3839eeb7887f40fc7265234","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/project/opus/","publishdate":"2023-12-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/opus/","section":"project","summary":"The OPUS project aims to develop and test an integrated AI-based system for the assisted and automatic annotation of historical masonries.

Quadrilateral C-meshes enjoy rich geometry and surprising relations with differential geometry: A structure that collapses onto a flat and straight strip corresponds to a Chebyshev net of curves on a surface of constant Gaussian curvature, while structures collapsing onto a circular strip follow surfaces which enjoy the linear-Weingarten property. Interestingly, allowing more general collapses actually leads to a smaller class of shapes. Hexagonal C-meshes have more degrees of freedom, but a local analysis suggests that there is no such direct relation to smooth surfaces. Besides theory, this paper provides tools for exploring the shape space of C-meshes and for their design. We also present an application for freeform architectural skins, namely paneling with spherical panels of constant radius, which is an important fabrication-related constraint.","tags":["Architectural Geometry","Digital Fabrication"],"title":"Deployable Strip Structures","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Francesco Laccone from @VisualCnr #ISTI-#CNR received the prestigious Nervi Prize at the #IWSS2023 (Italian Workshop on Shell and Spatial Structures) as talented young researcher working in the field of #shell and #spatial #structures.

Our technique leverages the recent advancements in inpainting of natural colour images, adapting them to the specific context. A neural network, modified and trained for our purposes, replaces the texture areas containing the defects, substituting them with new plausible patches of texels, reconstructed from the surrounding surface texture. We train and apply the network model on locally reparametrized texture patches, so to provide an input that simplifies the learning process, because it avoids any texture seams, unused texture areas, background, depth jumps and so on. We automatically extract appropriate training data from real-world datasets. We show two applications of the resulting method: one, as a fully automatic tool, addressing all problems that can be detected by analysing the UV-map of the input model; and another, as an interactive semi-automatic tool, presented to the user as a 3D ‘fixing’ brush that has the effect of removing artefacts from any zone the users paints on. We demonstrate our method on a variety of real-world inputs and provide a reference usable implementation.

For a panel painting, this technology facilitates the acquisition and documentation of its 3D shape at multiple scales, from the micro-geometry of craquelure to the macro-geometry of the support. All these geometric components may change over time due to the deformations induced by the conservation environment parameters. A usual method for estimating the deformation of the panel is the comparison of 3D models acquired at different times. For this purpose, the chapter presents a new approach to automatically estimate the amount of deformation between two 3D models of the same object. The proposed method is based on a nonrigid registration algorithm that deforms a 3D model on the other, enabling to separate the real panel deformation from the structural changes of the artwork. It uses only on the acquired geometric data of independent 3D acquisitions that were uncontrolled and unsupervised over time.","tags":["Digital Heritage"],"title":"Temporal Deformation Analysis of 3D Models as Diagnostic Tool for Panel Paintings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paolo Pingi","Eliana Siotto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"c45fad7d44757ec837b44c0e28dfc0b7","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2022/PS22/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022/PS22/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Digital Heritage"],"title":"Un modello 3D per lo studio ed il monitoraggio","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Laccone","Domenico Gaudioso","Luigi Malomo","Paolo Cignoni","Maurizio Froli"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"68744ff00ac71764b3bdc88c11c98d6d","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2022/LGMCF22/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022/LGMCF22/","section":"publication","summary":"In the context of tall building design, the tube concept represents one of the most performing systems. The diagrid is the widespread type of tube system and consists of a diagonal grid of beams that wraps the building, forming a diamond pattern. It performs as lateral bracing and is additionally able to sustain vertical loading through axial forces. Despite its efficiency, a growing interest is recently observed in alternative geometries to replace the diagrid pattern and improve the architectural impact conferred by the building skin aesthetics on the urban environment. The paper pursues the use of a Voronoi mesh, in which the geometry of the cells is steered to known schemes for the structural design of a cantilever tube structure. The objective is to mimic a macroscopic structural behavior through a topology and size modification of the Voronoi mesh that increases the density for creating resisting paths with higher stiffness. The paper proposes a novel method Vorogrid for designing a new class of tall buildings equipped with an organic-looking and mechanically-sound tube structure, which makes them a valuable alternative to competitors (diagrid, hexagrid, random Voronoi). Diagrids and hexagrids still remain more efficient in terms of forces and displacements but are characterized by a more usual appearance, instead Vorogrid offers more design control and better performances on average with respect to random Voronoi structures. This method is streamed into a pipeline that includes grid initialization strategies, geometric and structural optimization to mitigate the effects of the grid randomness, and structural sizing.","tags":["Architectural Geometry","Structural Optimization"],"title":"Vorogrid: A static-aware variable-density Voronoi mesh to design the tube structure tessellation of tall buildings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gaia Pavoni","Massimiliano Corsini","Federico Ponchio","Alessandro Muntoni","Paolo Cignoni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638316800,"objectID":"17eceacaec62c0cb558d9620c487a198","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2021/PCPMC21/","publishdate":"2021-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021/PCPMC21/","section":"publication","summary":"Fully automatic semantic segmentation of highly specific semantic classes and complex shapes may not meet the accuracy standards demanded by scientists.

This is the case of Antonello da Messina's painting 'Ecce Homo': its delicate state of conservation, with the need for constant monitoring, required a broad and in-depth diagnostic campaign to support the restorers. The project was carried out entirely in situ using non-invasive cutting-edge techniques and proposes a multimodal and data-centric approach, integrating 3D and 2D methodologies. The surface irregularities and the support were analysed with a structured-light 3D scanner and X-ray tomography. The painting materials were investigated with X-ray fluorescence scanning (MA-XRF) and reflectance hyperspectral imaging (HSI). Primarily, the data were jointly used for a scientific scope and provided new knowledge of the painting in terms of materials and painting techniques. In addition, two web-based interactive platforms were developed: one to provide restorers and experts with a new perspective of the hidden geometries of the painting, and the other targeted at the general public for dissemination purposes. The results of the Ecce Homo scientific analysis were exhibited, using a touch-screen interface, and developed for different user levels, from adults to kids.","tags":["Digital Heritage"],"title":"“Ecce Homo” by Antonello da Messina, from non-invasive investigations to data fusion and dissemination","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianpaolo Palma","Sara Perry","Paolo Cignoni"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1622505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622505600,"objectID":"f4cf8609beba0771597bf108b2beb8bb","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2021/PPC21/","publishdate":"2021-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021/PPC21/","section":"publication","summary":"Virtual reality (VR) technologies have become more and more affordable and popular in the last five years thanks to hardware and software advancements. A critical issue for these technologies is finding paradigms that allow user interactions in ways that are as similar as possible to the real world, bringing physicality into the experience. Current literature has shown, with different experiments, that the mapping of real objects in virtual reality alongside haptic feedback significantly increases the realism of the experience and user engagement, leading to augmented virtuality. In this paper, we present a system to improve engagement in a VR experience using inexpensive, physical, and sensorized copies of real artefacts made with cheap 3D fabrication technologies. Based on a combination of hardware and software components, the proposed system gives the user the possibility to interact with the physical replica in the virtual environment and to see the appearance of the original cultural heritage artefact. In this way, we overcome one of the main limitations of mainstream 3D fabrication technologies: a faithful appearance reproduction. Using a consumer device for the real-time hand tracking and a custom electronic controller for the capacitive touch sensing, the system permits the creation of augmented experiences where the user with their hands can change the virtual appearance of the real replica object using a set of personalization actions selectable from a physical 3D-printed palette.","tags":["Rendering and Advanced UI"],"title":"Augmented Virtuality Using Touch-Sensitive 3D-Printed Objects","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Eurographics conferred to VC Lab Head Paolo Cignoni the 2021 Outstanding Technical Contributions Award for his extraordinary technical contribution to 3D graphics!\n","date":1618963200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618963200,"objectID":"deaef6e335076fa513ab29d79c122fd5","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/post/21-04-21-paolo-cignoni-award/","publishdate":"2021-04-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/21-04-21-paolo-cignoni-award/","section":"post","summary":"Eurographics conferred to VC Lab Head Paolo Cignoni the 2021 Outstanding Technical Contributions Award for his extraordinary technical contribution to 3D graphics!\n","tags":null,"title":"Paolo Cignoni: Outstanding Technical Contributions Award","type":"post"},{"authors":["Daniele Fornari","Luigi Malomo","Paolo Cignoni"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"1c3e988b40c17c6166c87c5f58eaed02","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2021/FMC21/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021/FMC21/","section":"publication","summary":"The interaction between a 2D input device (like a mouse or a touchscreen) and a 3D object on the screen with the purpose of examining it in detail is a well-studied interaction problem. The inherent difference in degrees of freedom between input devices and possible 3D transformations makes it difficult to intuitively map inputs to operations to be performed on 3D objects. Although, over the years, studies led to a wide variety of solutions to overcome this problem, most of them are not actually available in real-world applications. In particular, for 3D web applications, only basic solutions are often implemented, and even the most used web framework for 3D still lacks state of the art implementations. We will face the problem of 3D interaction through touch and mouse input, and we propose our implementation of a 3D view manipulator for web applications, which offers a natural control, advanced functionalities, and provides an easy-to-use interface for both desktop and mobile environments.","tags":null,"title":"A High Quality 3D Controller for Mobile and Desktop Web Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefano Nuvoli","Alessandro Tola","Alessandro Muntoni","Nico Pietroni","Enrico Gobbetti","Riccardo Scateni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"78ce8e9a852c0cb419f01ee3c503fb8e","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2021/NTMPGS21/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021/NTMPGS21/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Automatic surface segmentation for seamless fabrication using 4-axis milling machines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gaia Pavoni","Massimiliano Corsini","Nicole Pedersen","Vid Petrovic","Paolo Cignoni"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"c49940461af31a07403751f61dd15347","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2021/PCPPC21/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021/PCPPC21/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Challenges in the deep learning-based semantic segmentation of benthic communities from Ortho-images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonios Makris","Abderrahmane Boudi","Massimo Coppola","Luís Cordeiro","Massimiliano Corsini","Patrizio Dazzi","Ferran Diego Andilla","Yago González Rozas","Manos Kamarianakis","Maria Pateraki","Thu Le Pham","Antonis Protopsaltis","Aravindh Raman","Alessandro Romussi","Luís Rosa","Elena Spatafora","Tarik Taleb","Theodoros Theodoropoulos","Konstantinos Tserpes","Enrico Zschau","Uwe Herzog"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"500f1ffa05ed1b2495e5bceed4cefe9f","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2021/BCCCDFGKPPPRRRSTTTZH21/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021/BCCCDFGKPPPRRRSTTTZH21/","section":"publication","summary":"The paper introduces the CHARITY framework, a novel framework which aspires to leverage the benefits of intelligent, network continuum autonomous orchestration of cloud, edge, and network resources, to create a symbiotic relationship between low and high latency infrastructures.

Since many resources are attributed to these buildings, their design should consider a proper performance-based construction economy and environmental sustainable development. This research introduces a new concept for a bundled tall building founded on the use of a multi-core-outrigger system, which is additionally enriched with diagrid structures. The concept is inspired by the bamboo plant and follows the biomimetic design principles for the structural organization and performance-based criteria for optimizing the lateral stiffness and for shaping the cross section. Particularly, the incident wind speed is maximized to exploit Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs), which are located along the whole building height at the center of the bundled towers. The building morphogenesis is accomplished by a multistep methodology that is fully developed in a parametric environment and includes structural and computational fluid dynamic analyses. With the aim of validating the proposed concept, a case study of a 320-m-tall three-core building has been designed for the city of Pisa, Italy. The use of VAWTs results in an annual emissions reduction of about 10 kgCO_2/m^2.   https://doi.org/10.1002/tal.1839","tags":null,"title":"Morphogenesis of a bundled tall building: Biomimetic, structural, and wind-energy design of a multi-core-outrigger system combined with diagrid","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Landi","Marcella Cornia","Lorenzo Baraldi","Massimiliano Corsini","Rita Cucchiara"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"666757699d5185d123a2de2e387da1f1","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2021/LCBCC21/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021/LCBCC21/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Multimodal attention networks for low-level vision-and-language navigation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nico Pietroni","Stefano Nuvoli","Thomas Alderighi","Paolo Cignoni","Marco Tarini"],"categories":null,"content":" 10.1145/3450626.3459941\nwww.quadmesh.cloud\nDownload the slides!

We define a perfectly feature-aligned cross-field and a coarse layout of polygonal-shaped patches where we strictly ensure that all the feature-lines are represented as patch boundaries. To be able to consistently do so, we allow non-quadrilateral patches and T-junctions in the layout; the key is the ability to constrain the layout so that it still admits a globally consistent, T-junction-free, and pure-quad internal tessellation of its patches. This requires the insertion of additional irregular-vertices inside patches, but the regularity of the final-mesh is safeguarded by optimizing for both their number and for their reciprocal alignment. In total, our method guarantees the reproduction of feature-lines by construction, while still producing good quality, isometric, pure-quad, conforming meshes, making it an ideal candidate for CAD models. Moreover, the method is fully automatic, requiring no user intervention, and remarkably reliable, requiring little assumptions on the input mesh, as we demonstrate by batch processing the entire Thingi10K repository, with less than 0.5% of the attempted cases failing to produce a usable mesh..

This class of 3D data is becoming increasingly important thanks to the growing popularity of reliable, ready-to-use photogrammetry software packages. The resulting textured models are richly detailed, but their underlying parametrization typically falls short of many practical requirements, particularly exhibiting excessive fragmentation and consequent problems. Producing a completely new UV-map, with standard parametrization techniques, and then resampling a new texture image, is often neither practical nor desirable for at least two reasons: first, these models have characteristics (such as inconsistencies, high resolution) that make them unfit for automatic or manual parametrization; second, the required resampling leads to unnecessary signal degradation because this process is unaware of the original texel densities. In contrast, our method improves the existing UV-map instead of replacing it, balancing the reduction of the map fragmentation with signal degradation due to resampling, while also avoiding oversampling of the original signal. The proposed approach is fully automatic and extensively tested on a large benchmark of photo-reconstructed models; quantitative evaluation evidences a drastic and consistent improvement of the mappings.   https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.142615    Reference implementation available at https://github.com/maggio-a/texture-defrag","tags":["Geometry Processing","3D Scanning"],"title":"Texture Defragmentation for Photo-Reconstructed 3D Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Potenziani","Francesco Banterle","Marco Callieri","Matteo Dellepiane","Federico Ponchio","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"84cdd7b9319669362fad10d88e8663ce","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2021/PBCDPS21/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021/PBCDPS21/","section":"publication","summary":"Digital technologies are now mature for producing high quality digital replicas of Cultural Heritage (CH) artifacts.

The desired deformation of the panels derives from the proper selection of their elastic properties. Optimized panels, called FlexMaps, are designed such that, once they are bent and assembled, the resulting static equilibrium configuration matches a desired input 3D shape. The FlexMaps elastic properties are controlled by locally varying spiraling geometric mesostructures, which are optimized in size and shape to match specific bending requests, namely the global curvature of the target shape. The design pipeline starts from a quad mesh representing the input 3D shape, which defines the edge size and the total amount of spirals: every quad will embed one spiral. Then, an optimization algorithm tunes the geometry of the spirals by using a simplified pre-computed rod model. This rod model is derived from a non-linear regression algorithm which approximates the non-linear behavior of solid FEM spiral models subject to hundreds of load combinations. This innovative pipeline has been applied to the project of a lightweight plywood pavilion named FlexMaps Pavilion, which is a single-layer piecewise twisted arch that fits a bounding box of 3.90x3.96x3.25 meters. This case study serves to test the applicability of this methodology at the architectural scale. The structure is validated via FE analyses and the fabrication of the full scale prototype.

This work is generally carried out by specialists that, based on visual observation and their knowledge, manually annotate ortho-images of the masonry generated by photogrammetric surveys. This results in vectorial thematic maps segmented according to their construction technique (isolating areas of homogeneous materials/structure/texture) or state of conservation, including degradation areas and damaged parts. This time-consuming manual work, often done with tools that have not been designed for this purpose, represents a bottleneck in the documentation and management workflow and is a severely limiting factor in monitoring large-scale monuments (e.g.city walls).

However, they pose two significant challenges. The first one is to assure adequate safety and redundancy concerning possible global collapse. Being single-layered, in a shell made of structural glass, the brittle cracking of a single pane can lead to a sudden propagation of failure, up to instability. The second one is to guarantee cheap replacing possibilities for potentially collapsed components. This research explores a novel concept to address both requirements, where glass is both post-tensioned and reinforced and develops the research on TVT post-tensioned glass beams. Following the Fail- Safe Design (FSD) principles, a steel reinforcement relieves glass deficiencies (i.e. brittleness and low tensile strength). Following the Damage Avoidance Design (DAD) principles, glass segmentation and post-tensioning avoid the propagation of cracks. Up to now, glass-steel systems were limited to mono-dimensional elements (such as beams and columns) or simple bi-dimensional elements (arches, domes, barrel vaults). Instead, massive structures are usually realized as grid shells, where glass is used as simple cladding. This research investigates piecewise triangulated glass shells to enable the creation of 3D free-form glass-steel systems, where glass is load-bearing material. Hence, laminated glass panels are mechanically coupled with a filigree steel truss, whose elements are placed at the edges of the panel and act as an unbonded reinforcement. In a performance-based perspective, these steel trusses can be sized to bear at least the weight of all panels in the occurrence of simultaneous cracks (worst-case scenario). The panels are post-tensioned using a set of edge-aligned cables that add beneficial compressive stress on glass to prevent crack initiation. The cable placement and accompanying pre-loads are derived with an optimization strategy that minimizes the tensile stress acting on the shell. This optimization procedure also considers the practical constraints involved in the process. The results obtained through this automated procedure are later investigated using nonlinear FE analyses. The resulting structures optimize the total material usage providing contemporarily both transparency and load-bearing capabilities. Posttensioned shells excel in static performances, achieving high stiffness and good redundancy for the worst-case scenario, and improve the structural lightness and the visual impact with respect to state-of-the-art competitors.","tags":null,"title":"Automated Design and Analysis of Reinforced and Post-Tensioned Glass Shells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giovanni Pintore","Claudio Mura","Fabio Ganovelli","Lizeth Fuentes-Perez","Renato Pajarola","Enrico Gobbetti"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"8296cea4017c830fff49f3ca4c4cc9b7","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2020/PMGFPG20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020/PMGFPG20/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Automatic 3D Reconstruction of Structured Indoor Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maurizio Froli","Francesco Laccone"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"b25b7b3d0087db72f474d182e70aa942","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2020/FL20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020/FL20/","section":"publication","summary":"The paper introduces a novel concept for structural glass shells that is based on the mechanical coupling of double curved heat-bent glass panels and a wire frame mesh, which constitutes a grid of unbonded edge-reinforcement.

The main novelty lies in the use of polygonal curved panelswith a nodal force transfer mechanism. This concept has been validated on an illustrative design case of a 6 m-diameter suspended glass sphere, in which regular pentagonal and hexagonal spherical panels are employed. The good strength and stiffness achieved for this structure is demonstrated by means of local and global FE models. Another fundamental feature of the concept is that the reinforcement grid provides residual strength in the extreme scenarios in which all panels are completely failed.

Digital 3D models of this class come with a unique set of characteristics and defects - especially concerning their parametrization - setting them starkly apart from 3D models originating from other, more traditional, sources. We study this class of 3D models by collecting a significant number of representatives and quantitatively evaluating their quality according to several metrics. These include a new invariant metric we carefully design to assess the amount of fragmentation of the UV map, which is one of the main weaknesses potentially hindering the usability of these models. Our results back the widely shared notion that models of this new class are still not fit for direct use in downstream applications (such as videogames), and require challenging processing steps. Regrettably, existing automatic geometry processing tools are not always up to the task: for example, we verify that the available tools for UV optimization often fail due to mesh inconsistencies, geometric and topological noise, excessive resolution, or other factors; moreover, even when an output is produced, it rarely represents a significant improvement over the input (according to the aforementioned measures). Therefore, we argue that further advancements are required by the computer graphics and geometry processing communities specifically targeted at this class of models. Towards this goal, we share the models we collected in this study as a new public repository, Real-World Textured Things (RWTT), intended as a benchmark to systematic field-test and compare future algorithms. RWTT  consists of 568 carefully selected textured 3D models representative of the most popular photo-reconstruction tools currently available.

Most previous work can generate either only ribs or only variablethickness walls. However, in the general case, neither approach by itself will provide optimal solutions. By using a more precise volume model, our method is capable of producing optimized structures with the full range of qualitative behaviors: from ribs to walls, and smoothly transitioning in between. Our method includes new algorithms for determining the layout of reinforcement structure elements, and an efficient algorithm to optimize their shape, minimizing a non-linear non-convex functional at a fraction of the cost and with better optimality compared to standard solvers.

In the subsequent decades, topology would have a great influence on the way in which artists and architects sensed and represented space. Among them, the Italian architect Vittorio Giorgini (1926 - 2010) pioneered the topology-flavoured ideas of elastic surfaces and of form as a dynamic structure. Beside his architectural works, Giorgini left a few enchanting sculptures, in which he explored the connection between shape and topology. In this paper, we first present Giorgini's beautiful architectural designs, which were largely unrecognized in his lifetime, and they have only recently started to receive the attention they deserved. Then, we explain the topological ideas behind six of his sculptures, in a formal mathematical language. Surprisingly enough for non-mathematicians, four of his most famous sculptures - Modified Klein, Giorgini Sphere, Giorgini Torus I, and Giorgini Torus III - turn out to be topologically equivalent. This means that they can be continuously deformed into one another, even though their geometric appearances are very different from each other. We first illustrate by drawing the steps in the deformation process. Then, we provide a formal proof of the equivalence using basic notions from algebraic topology: non-orientable genus, Euler characteristic, and the classification theorem for surfaces. Giorgini designed his three-dimensional figures in-between the late 1960's and the first half of the 2000's. The figures only existed as bi-dimensional drawings for many years. Then, Giorgini asked David Dainelli and Alessandro Marzetti to carve alabaster sculptures from his drawings, in their artistic workshop in Volterra (Pisa, Italy), under his direct supervision. Giorgini's sculptures represent non-orientable surfaces. Intuitively, non-orientable surfaces are one-sided: one could paint in colour the whole surface without crossing its boundary and without detaching the brush. That would not be possible for orientable surfaces such as the familiar cylinder and sphere, which are two-sided. The first sculpture we present is Modified Klein, a Klein bottle with a disk removed. The Klein bottle is a well-known and fascinating example of a non-orientable surface, which not only is one-sided, but also closed (it has no boundaries) while it does not enclose an interior. As it often happens with physical reproductions of the Klein bottle, Giorgini cut a disk around the surface self-intersection. The other three sculptures named Giorgini Sphere, Giorgini Torus I, and Giorgini Torus III are constructed through variations on the same procedure: start from a sphere (a torus), cut away portions of the surface to make a cylinder, then connect the top and bottom boundaries of the cylinder with a strip without twisting, to get a non-orientable surface. What would sound surprising to a non-topologist is that, beside being neither spheres nor toruses, the three sculptures are topologically equivalent to Modified Klein. All four sculptures are non-orientable surfaces with one boundary, and after some calculations one can verify they all have non-orientable genus equal to 2: being the non-orientable genus a topological invariant, the four sculptures share the same topological type. In our paper, for illustration purposes, we draw eight steps in the deformation process which takes Modified Klein to Giorgini Torus I. Finally, we report on the topological type of two other sculptures: Giorgini Torus II, a non-orientable surface with three boundaries which has the topology of a Moebius strip minus two disks, and Giorgini Torus IV, a non-orientable surface with two boundaries which has the topology of a sphere with five holes, three of which are capped by Moebius strips.\nBridges 2020 presentation (.pptx)\nDeforming Modified Kein into Giorgini Torus I (.mp4)\n\n\n\nVittorio Giorgini: Architetture d'Alabastro, by Duccio Benvenuti","tags":null,"title":"Topological Classification of Vittorio Giorgini’s Sculptures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rachele Manganelli del Fà","Giovanni Pancani","Giovanni Minutoli","Andrea Arrighetti","Gabriella Poggesi","Marco Callieri"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"cfee99e0d8a1b27f1e0cd15cf300f687","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2020/PAMPMC20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020/PAMPMC20/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Tumulo etrusco della Montagnola: un viaggio virtuale","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicola Capece","Francesco Banterle","Paolo Cignoni","Fabio Ganovelli","Ugo Erra"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"79661e84a1fb12dc90ffed796d504a77","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2020/CBCGE20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020/CBCGE20/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Turning a Smartphone Selfie Into a Studio Portrait ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maurizio Froli","Francesco Laccone","Agnese Natali"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"b6071e201fdda833229cb473a9e33b69","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2020/FLN20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020/FLN20/","section":"publication","summary":"Transparency and structural lightness are inspiring ideas in the design of footbridges. Glass is the most performing transparent material to be used for structural purposes because of its high compressive strength, chemical stability, and absence of fatigue and viscosity phenomena at room temperature. However, its fragility constitutes a challenging limit in structural applications. This research provides and discusses a specific concept named TVTÎ´ (Travi Vitree Tensegrity) for lightweight long-span beam-like footbridges made of structural glass. Hence, two design approaches of fail-safe design (FSD) and damage avoidance design (DAD) are applied to guarantee adequate safety levels and postcracking serviceability, respectively, with low damages on the main components. FSD provides the adoption of structural collaboration between glass and steel. Following DAD, glass is segmented into triangular panels, and reciprocal diffuse prestress is performed by steel tendons. This strategy assures low rehabilitation costs because only collapsed elements should be replaced once failed. At ultimate limit state (ULS), the TVTÎ´ footbridge attains a global ductile behavior in which the yielding of steel tendons occurs before any fragile failure. Such result is achieved through a hierarchic calibration of the chain of failures. In glass panels, which are mostly precompressed, the buckling failure, representing the main risk, is delayed by the mutual stabilization of the panels' compressed edges with steel clamping. However, because an accidental event may cause a localized or diffuse brittle failure of glass components, the system is designed to maintain a residual load bearing capacity in this scenario. At the serviceability limit state (SLS), the TVTÎ´ footbridge is highly stiffened by the presence of glass panes, partially encased in metallic frames. Crack initiation is delayed by precompression.","tags":null,"title":"TVTδ Concept for Long-Span Glass–Steel Footbridges","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mattia Angelini","Vito Ferrulli","Francesco Banterle","Massimiliano Corsini","Maria Antonietta Pascali","Paolo Cignoni","Daniela Giorgi"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"5add4c7e95033cdd1ec00b9a4dac48d8","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2020/AFBCPCG20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020/AFBCPCG20/","section":"publication","summary":"We present the ongoing effort to build the first benchmark dataset for aestethic prediction on 3D models. The dataset is built on top of Sketchfab,  a popular platform for 3D content sharing. In our dataset, the visual 3D content is aligned with aesthetics-related metadata: each 3D model is associated with a number  of snapshots taken from different camera positions, the number of times the model has been viewed in-between its upload and its retrieval, the number of likes the model got,  and the tags and comments received from users. The metadata provide precious supervisory information for data-driven research on 3D visual attractiveness and preference prediction.  The paper contribution is twofold. First, we introduce an interactive platform for visualizing data about Sketchfab. We report a detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis  of numerical scores (views and likes collected by 3D models) and textual information (tags and comments) for different 3D object categories.  The analysis of the content of Sketchfab provided us the base for selecting a reasoned subset of annotated models. The second contribution is  the first version of the ViDA 3D dataset, which contains the full set of content required for data-driven approaches to 3D aesthetic analysis.  While similar datasets are available for images, to our knowledge this is the first attempt to create a benchmark for aestethic prediction for 3D models.

Although rendering and processing such data has been extensively studied, little attention has been devoted using the light transport hidden in the recorded per-sample color response to relight virtual objects in visual effects (VFX) look-dev or augmented reality (AR) scenarios. Typically, standard relighting environment exploits global environment maps together with a collection of local light probes to reflect the light mood of the real scene on the virtual object. We propose instead a unified spatial approximation of the radiance and visibility relationships present in the scene, in the form of a colored point cloud. To do so, our method relies on two core components: High Dynamic Range (HDR) expansion and real-time Point-Based Global Illumination (PBGI). First, since an acquired color point cloud typically comes in Low Dynamic Range (LDR) format, we boost it using a single HDR photo exemplar of the captured scene that can cover part of it. We perform this expansion efficiently by first expanding the dynamic range of a set of renderings of the point cloud and then projecting these renderings on the original cloud. At this stage, we propagate the expansion to the regions not covered by the renderings or with low-quality dynamic range by solving a Poisson system. Then, at rendering time, we use the resulting HDR point cloud to relight virtual objects, providing a diffuse model of the indirect illumination propagated by the environment. To do so, we design a PBGI algorithm that exploits the GPU's geometry shader stage as well as a new mipmapping operator, tailored for G-buffers, to achieve real-time performances. As a result, our method can effectively relight virtual objects exhibiting diffuse and glossy physically-based materials in real time. Furthermore, it accounts for the spatial embedding of the object within the 3D environment. We evaluate our approach on manufactured scenes to assess the error introduced at every step from the perfect ground truth. We also report experiments with real captured data, covering a range of capture technologies, from active scanning to multiview stereo reconstruction.","tags":["Rendering and Advanced UI"],"title":"High Dynamic Range Point Clouds for Real-Time Relighting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianpaolo Palma","Paolo Pingi","Eliana Siotto","Roberto Bellucci","Gabriele Guidi","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"1b14ab7b888b64589eb10d100c2265c6","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2019/PPSBGS19a/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019/PPSBGS19a/","section":"publication","summary":"3D scanning is an effective technology for dealing at different levels the state of  conservation/deformation of a panel painting, from the micro-geometry of the craquelure to the macro-geometry of the supported used. Unfortunately, the current solutions used to analyze multiple 3D scans acquired over time are based on very controlled acquisition procedures, such as the use of target reference points that are stationary over time and fixed to the artwork, or on complex hardware setups to keep the acquisition device fixed to the artwork. These procedures are challenging when a long monitoring period is involved or during restoration when the painting may be moved several times. This paper presents a new and robust approach to observe and quantify the panel deformations of artworks by comparing 3D models acquired with different scanning devices at different times. The procedure is based on a non-rigid registration algorithm that deforms one 3D model over the other in a controlled way, extracting the real deformation field. We apply the method to the 3D scanning data of the unfinished panel painting ''Adorazione dei Magi'' by Leonardo da Vinci. The data were acquired in 2002 and 2015. First, we analyze the two 3D models with the classical distance from the ideal flat plane of the painting. Then we study the type of deformation of each plank of the support by fitting a quadric surface. Finally, we compare the models before and after the deformation computed by a non-rigid registration algorithm. This last comparison enables the panel deformation to be separated from the structural changes (e.g. the structural restorations on the back and the missing pieces) of the artwork in a more robust way.","tags":null,"title":"Deformation analysis of Leonardo da Vinci's ''Adorazione dei Magi'' through temporal unrelated 3D digitization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Callieri","Matteo Dellepiane","Aurelia Lureau","Gaia Pavoni","Paolo Pingi","Marco Potenziani","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"91d8b1817e0830b466779550b13c7faf","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2019/CDLPPPS19/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019/CDLPPPS19/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Digital Heritage"],"title":"Rilievo 3D di Alchimia, ed uso dei modelli 3D per studio e divulgazione","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alessandro Vecchione","Aurelia Lureau","Marco Callieri"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"136b947d50142184d8ea60ce457e9024","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2019/VLC19/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019/VLC19/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"3D archaeological data management via web: The experience with 3DHOP software","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Pamart","Violette  Abergel1","Federico Ponchio","Massimiliano Corsini","Matteo Dellepiane","Roberto Scopigno","Livio de Luca"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"d6a4ab862dcb7037b3d7c39012e8c459","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2019/PAPCDSD19/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019/PAPCDSD19/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A complete framework toward Spatially-Oriented RTI for CH documentation and analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maurizio Froli","Linda Giresini","Francesco Laccone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"90ba280ca5ef63a753cb0306e3122bfa","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2019/FGL19/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019/FGL19/","section":"publication","summary":"A novel isolation device is introduced to seismically protect slender structures or historic assets within the philosophy of Damage Avoidance Design (DAD).

Biological structures are more similar to textures, and specimen borders exhibit intricate shapes. In this specific context, manual labelling is very sensitive to human error. The interactive validation of the predictions is a valuable resource to improve the network performance and address the inaccuracy caused by the lack of annotation consistency of human operators reported in literature. The proposed tool, inspired by the Yes/No Answer paradigm, integrates the semantic segmentation results coming from a CNN with the previous human labeling, allowing a more accurate annotation of thousands of instances in a short time.

However, they pose two signicant challenges: the rst one is to assure adequate safety and redundancy concerning possible global collapse; the second one is to guarantee the economy for replacing collapsed components. To address both requirements, this research explores a novel concept where triangular panels of structural glass are both post-tensioned and reinforced to create 3D free-form systems. Hence, the ligree steel truss, made of edges reinforcements, is sized in performance-based perspective to bear at least the weight of all panels in the occurrence of simultaneous cracks (worst-case scenario). The panels are post-tensioned using a set of edge-aligned cables that add benecial compressive stress on the surface.

However, mimicking the HVS is known to be complex and computationally expensive (both in terms of time and memory), and its usage is thus limited to a few applications and to small input data. All of this makes such metrics not fully attractive in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose Deep Image Quality Metric (DIQM), a deep-learning approach to learn the global image quality feature (mean-opinion-score). DIQM can emulate existing visual metrics efficiently, reducing the computational costs by more than an order of magnitude with respect to existing implementations.\n\n\nTimings Our method is extremely computationally efficient because the transfer of knowledge from HDR-VDP to a CNN allows us to speed-up computations by performing only simple convolutions. When we compare our method (DIQM) to classic HDR-VDP (MATLAB implementation and its CUDA version), we can measure 1-2 orders of magnitude of speed-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications Our method can be employed to optimize the parameters for HDR compression, tone mapping, and inverse tone mapping. This can be achieved with classic metrics such as HDR-VDP and DRIIM.

Our method can manage these tasks in a few seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTone mapped HDR image without parameters optimization.

The desired deformation of the panels derives from the proper selection of their elastic properties. Optimized panels, called FlexMaps, are designed such that, once they are bent and assembled, the resulting static equilibrium configuration matches a desired input 3D shape. The FlexMaps elastic properties are controlled by locally varying spiraling geometric mesostructures, which are optimized in size and shape to match the global curvature (i.e., bending requests) of the target shape. The design pipeline starts from a quad mesh representing the input 3D shape, which determines the edge size and the total amount of spirals: every quad will embed one spiral. Then, an optimization algorithm tunes the geometry of the spirals by using a simplified pre-computed rod model. This rod model is derived from a non-linear regression algorithm which approximates the non-linear behavior of solid FEM spiral models subject to hundreds of load combinations.

Tone mapping a part of the 360° image is less challenging as it does not preserve the global luminance dynamic of the scene.

Our method generates shapes that, once unfolded, can be fabricated with CNC milling machines using special tools called V-Grooves.

Milling the edges of each flat facet simplifies the manual assembly, which consists only in folding adjacent facets at a constrained angle. Our method generates simplified shapes where every dihedral angle between adjacent facets belongs to a restricted set, thus making the assembly process quicker and more straightforward. Firstly, our method automatically computes a simplified version of the input model, using the marching cubes algorithm on the original mesh and iteratively performing local changes on the resulting triangle mesh. The user can then perform an additional manual simplification to remove unwanted facets. Finally, an unfolding algorithm, which takes into account the thickness of the material, flattens the polygonal facets onto the 2D plane, so that a CNC milling machine can fabricate it from a sheet of rigid material.","tags":null,"title":"Mill and fold: Shape simplification for fabrication","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefano Nuvoli","Alex Hernandez","Claudio Esperança","Riccardo Scateni","Paolo Cignoni","Nico Pietroni"],"categories":null,"content":"here\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"a5789efe0d49952b845607218a6f5060","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2019/NHESCP19/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019/NHESCP19/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose QuadMixer, a novel interactive technique to compose quad mesh components preserving the majority of the original layouts.

We define suitable pseudo-metrics for the function spaces, the equivariance groups and the set of non-expansive operators. We prove that, under suitable assumptions, the space of GENEOs is compact and convex. These results provide fundamental guarantees in a machine learning perspective.

To that end, we derive a base model for integrating density in (intersecting) spheres for both the uniform and non-uniform setting and introduce a simple and fast approximation which yields interactive rendering speeds for millions of points. Because our method only relies on the basic OpenGL rasterization pipeline, rendering properties can be adjusted in real-time by user.

Then, we improve the alignment using few geometric constraints and finally, we build a global deformation function that blends the estimated per-patch transformations. This function is structured on top of a deformation graph derived from the dual graph of the clustering. Our algorithm is iterated until convergence, increasing progressively the number of patches in the clustering to capture smaller deformations. The method comes with a scalable multicore implementation that enables, for the first time, the alignment of meshes made of tens of millions of triangles in a few minutes. We report extensive experiments of our algorithm on several dense Multi-View Stereo models, using a 3D scan or another MVS reconstruction as reference. Beyond MVS data, we also applied our algorithm to different scenarios, exhibiting more complex and larger deformations, such as 3D motion capture dataset or 3D scans of dynamic objects.

In this paper, we propose a dynamic technique for the effective visualization of detected differences between two 3D scenes. The presented approach, while retaining the original appearance, allows the user to switch between the two models in a way that enhances the geometric differences that have been detected as significant. Additionally, the same technique is able to visually hides the other negligible, yet visible, variations. The main idea is to use two distinct screen space time-based interpolation functions for the significant 3D differences and for the small variations to hide.

Despite the increasing HDR popularity, very little attention has been devoted to new forensic problems that are characteristic to this content. In this paper, we address for the first time such kind of problem, by identifying the source of an HDR picture. Specifically, we consider the two currently most common techniques to generate an HDR image: by fusing multiple LDR images with different exposure time, or by inverse tone mapping an LDR picture. We show that, in order to apply conventional forensic tools to HDR images, they need to be properly preprocessed, and we propose and evaluate a few simple HDR forensic preprocessing strategies for this purpose. In addition, we propose a new forensic feature based on Fisher scores, calculated under Gaussian mixture models. We show that the proposed feature outperforms the popular SPAM features in classifying the HDR image source on image blocks as small as 3x3, which makes our method suitable to detect composite forgeries combining HDR patches originating from different acquisition processes.

We demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of our approach on real-world indoor scenes and publicly available datasets.","tags":null,"title":"Recovering 3D indoor floorplans by exploiting low-cost 360 photography","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniela Pica","Gaia Pavoni","Ubaldo Pantaleo","Monica Rivas Casado","Marco Palma","Carlo Cerrano"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"5e99352cea835a209ca93389f2853275","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2018/PRPPPC18/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018/PRPPPC18/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"SfM-Based Method to Assess Gorgonian Forests (Paramuricea clavata (Cnidaria, Octocorallia))","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alessandro Muntoni","Andreas Scalas","Stefano Nuvoli","Riccardo Scateni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"3acc7b530c089e5857405a228ec8729b","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2018/MSNS18/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018/MSNS18/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Simplification of Shapes for Fabrication with V-Groove Milling Tools","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bernd Bickel","Paolo Cignoni","Luigi Malomo","Nico Pietroni"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"4daea7684bd7418d4dce382eda451007","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2018/BCMP18/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018/BCMP18/","section":"publication","summary":"Digital fabrication devices are powerful tools for creating tangible reproductions of 3D digital models.

The research results produced in the last decade ignited an impressive evolution and consolidation of the technologies for acquiring high-quality digital three-dimensional (3D) models, encompassing both geometry and color. What remains still an open problem is how to deliver those data and related knowledge to our society. The web is nowadays the main channel for the dissemination of knowledge. Emerging commercial solutions for web-publishing of 3D data are consolidating and becoming a de-facto standard for many applications (e-commerce, industrial products, education, etc.). In this framework, CH is a very specific domain, requiring highly flexible solutions. Some recent experiences are presented, aimed at providing a support to the archival of archaeological 3D data, supporting web-based publishing of very high-resolution digitization results and finally enabling the documentation of complex restoration actions. All those examples have been recently implemented on the open-source 3D Heritage Online Presenter (3DHOP) platform, developed at CNR-ISTI.","tags":["Digital Heritage"],"title":"Delivering and using 3D models on the web: are we ready?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabrizio Ivan Apollonio","Vilma Basilissi","Marco Callieri","Matteo Dellepiane","Marco Gaiani","Federico Ponchio","Francesca Rizzo","Angelo Rubino","Roberto Scopigno","Giorgio Sobrà"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"18adaeecf6f450dd6fab960f908e1b44","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2017/ABCDGPRRSS17/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017/ABCDGPRRSS17/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"A 3D-centered information system for the documentation of a complex restoration intervention","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Banterle","Alessandro Artusi","Kurt Debattista","Alan Chalmers"],"categories":null,"content":"link to the official website\nlink to the HDR Toolbox git repository\n","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"456a28f830ea2f7a84bf8ed698db14ab","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2017/BADC17/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017/BADC17/","section":"publication","summary":"abstract\n\n\n\n\n\nlink to the official website\n\nlink to the HDR Toolbox git repository\n\n\nTable of Contents This book is a practical introduction to the field of High Dynamic Range imaging that combines photography, computer vision, and computer graphics.

Tensegrities are known to be difficult to design---existing design methods are often restricted to using symmetric or templated configurations, limiting the design space to simple constructions. We introduce an algorithm to automatically create free-form stable tensegrity designs that satisfy both fabrication and geometric constraints, and faithfully approximate input geometric shapes. Our approach sidesteps the usual force-based approach in favor of a geometric optimization on the positions of the elements.

Nevertheless, the integration in a \tweb page of a single 3D model, or of a predefined restricted set of models, raises different issues compared to an efficient and effective integration of thousands of them in an online repository. In this case it is mandatory to have an automatized pipeline to prepare and homogenize the dataset. The pipeline should be able to automatically wrap 3D data in all conditions, and display every single model with the best scene setup without any (or with a minimal) interaction by the database maintainers. This paper, retracing the steps of a recent real application case, aims at showing all the faced issues (and the adopted solutions) to publish a large and heterogeneous three-dimensional dataset in a web specialized repository. We want to introduce a valid and reusable strategy, starting from the description of the pipeline adopted for data pre-processing and moving to the choices made in the 3D viewer implementation. The paper concludes with a discussion on the actual state of the integration of 3D data with the other multimedia informative layers.","tags":["Digital Heritage"],"title":"Automating Large 3D Dataset Publication in a Web-Based Multimedia Repository","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianpaolo Palma","Paolo Cignoni","Tamy Boubekeur","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472688e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472688e3,"objectID":"1d3096554a35d763d282b8b89e8bd6d8","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2016/PCBS16/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016/PCBS16/","section":"publication","summary":"Detecting geometric changes between two 3D captures of the same location performed at different moments is a critical operation for all systems requiring a precise segmentation between change and no-change regions. Such application scenarios include 3D surface reconstruction, environment monitoring, natural events management and forensic science. Unfortunately, typical 3D scanning setups cannot provide any one-to-one mapping between measured samples in static regions: in particular, both extrinsic and intrinsic sensor parameters may vary over time while sensor noise and outliers additionally corrupt the data. In this paper, we adopt a multi-scale approach to robustly tackle these issues. Starting from two point clouds, we first remove outliers using a probabilistic operator. Then, we detect the actual change using the implicit surface defined by the point clouds under a Growing Least Square reconstruction that, compared to the classical proximity measure, offers a more robust change/no-change characterization near the temporal intersection of the scans and in the areas exhibiting different sampling density and direction. The resulting classification is enhanced with a spatial reasoning step to solve critical geometric configurations that are common in man-made environments. We validate our approach on a synthetic test case and on a collection of real data sets acquired using commodity hardware. Finally, we show how 3D reconstruction benefits from the resulting precise change/no-change segmentation.","tags":null,"title":"Detection of Geometric Temporal Changes in Point Clouds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Ponchio","Marco Potenziani","Matteo Dellepiane","Marco Callieri","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1456790400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1456790400,"objectID":"427e4fe37460af7c57415091f70e0e46","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2016/PPDCS16/","publishdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016/PPDCS16/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper describes the design and development of a service for \"visual media\" files.

The service provides a very easy interface (a simple web form) that allows the user to upload the visual media file; the data is then transformed in a web-compliant format, supporting multi-resolution encoding, compression, and progressive transmission. At the end of the data-processing phase the user receives an email containing the URL of the published asset (or, in case he/she wants to store the file locally, a .zip file).

This kind of structures can be easily built in relatively unprepared sites, dismantled, transported and re-used even by not specialized handcraft. For these reasons, reciprocal structures have been widely used in the past for military purposes, and nowadays they seem to satisfy very well the different requirements of a quick and temporary shelter of a large archaeological area when they are shaped as grid shells.      This paper proposes the design of a reversible, reciprocal framed grid shell to shelter the archaeological site of the Roman Shipwrecks in Pisa. The structure must protect excavations and archaeologists from the weather and provide an easy access to visitors. Additionally, it must allow for easy disassembling and moving to another site.  The design choices aim at optimizing both structural efficiency and esthetical qualities. A parametric workflow for both the form finding and the digital fabrication processes has been developed, and a prototype of accommodative steel T-joint for timber reciprocal beams has been realized. Finally, a model using CNC- cutting tested the structural feasibility of such a design approach.","tags":null,"title":"Conception and parametric design workflow for a timber large-spanned reversible grid shell to shelter the archaeological site of the Roman Shipwrecks in Pisa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriele Salvati","Claudio Calabrese","Marco Tarini","Fabio Pellacini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"f3efd0be7e232fb59fdfbf07b4f50e3a","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2016/CSTP16/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016/CSTP16/","section":"publication","summary":"Collaborative systems are well established solutions for sharing work among people. In computer graphics these workflows are still not well established, compared to what is done for text writing or software development. Usually artists work alone and share their final models by sending files. In this paper we present a system for collaborative 3D digital sculpting. In our prototype, multiple artists concurrently sculpt a polygonal mesh on their local machines by changing its vertex properties, such as positions and material BRDFs. Our system shares the artists' edits automatically and seamlessly merges these edits even when they happen on the same region of the surface. We propose a merge algorithm that is fast-enough for seamless collaboration, respects users' edits as much as possible, can support any sculpting operation, and works for both geometry and appearance modifications. Since in sculpting artists alternatively perform fine adjustments and large scale modifications, our algorithm is based on a multiresolution edit representation that handles concurrent overlapping edits at different scales. We tested our algorithm by modeling meshes collaboratively in different sculpting sessions and found that our algorithm outperforms prior works on collaborative mesh editing in all cases.","tags":null,"title":"cSculpt: A System for Collaborative Sculpting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Davide Tonelli","Nico Pietroni","Paolo Cignoni","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"9a5af345861e3019ddf100a509a62186","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2016/TPCS16/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016/TPCS16/","section":"publication","summary":"Statics Aware Voronoi Grid-shells have been recently introduced in the Architectural Geometry field.

Recently, unofficial firmware for cameras has started to appear, and the firmware allows for reprogramming of the system to capture footage with an extended dynamic range. The dynamic range that can be captured in a single shot, however, is still limited and does not fully cover the dynamic range found in high-contrast scenes. There is, therefore, a need for low-cost techniques that allow for HDR-video capture using off-the-shelf equipment.

To establish the TMO that performs better in each luminance zone we conducted a preliminary psychophysical experiment using a set of HDR images and six different TMOs.

We present an alternative representation, volume-encoded UV-maps, in which each point on the surface is mapped to a uv position which is solely a function of its 3D position. This function is tailored for a target surface: its restriction to the surface is a parametrization exhibiting high quality, e.g. in terms of angle and area preservation; and, near the surface, it is almost constant for small orthogonal displacements.The representation is applicable to a wide range of shapes and UV-maps, and unlocks several key advantages: it removes the need to duplicate vertices in the mesh to encode cuts in the map; it makes the UV-map representation independent from the meshing of the surface; the same texture, and even the same UV-map, can be shared by multiple geometrically similar models (e.g.alllevelsofa LoDpyramid); UV-maps can be applied to representations other than polygonal meshes, like point clouds or set of registered range-maps.Our schema is cheap on GPU computational and memory resources, requiring only a single, cache-coherent indirection to a small volumetric texture per fragment.We also provide an algorithm to construct a volume-encoded UV-map given a target surface.           \t Project page (with demo, sources, etc).","tags":null,"title":"Volume-encoded UV-maps","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabrizio Galeazzi","Marco Callieri","Matteo Dellepiane","Michael Charmo","Julian Richards","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"4db6c93fae6c4dafc72041fb080d87c7","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2016/GCDCRS16/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016/GCDCRS16/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Web-based visualization for 3D data in archaeology: The ADS 3D viewer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Potenziani","Marco Callieri","Matteo Dellepiane","Massimiliano Corsini","Federico Ponchio","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1446336e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1446336e3,"objectID":"7a6f600051656d5a49388173891608b4","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2015/PCDCPS15/","publishdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015/PCDCPS15/","section":"publication","summary":"3D Heritage Online Presenter (3DHOP) is a framework for the creation of advanced web-based visual presentations of high-resolution 3D content. 3DHOP has been designed to cope with the specific needs of the Cultural Heritage (CH) field.

In its design and development, we paid particular attention to three factors: easiness of use, smooth learning curve and performances. Thanks to its modular nature and a declarative-like setup, it is easy to learn, configure, and customize at different levels, depending on the programming skills of the user. This allows people with different background to always obtain the required power and flexibility from the framework. 3DHOP is written in JavaScript and it is based on the SpiderGL library, which employs the WebGL subset of HTML5, implementing plugin-free 3D rendering on many web browsers.

The 3D model was integrated in the conservation process, along with the other diagnostic investigations; the geometric data was also used to produce images and video sequences for dissemination purposes. The most interesting aspect of the work, however, was the idea of going beyond photo-realism and the use of the scanner-measured geometry to try to interpret and understand the traces and signs on the surface of the painting, in relation with the gestures and techniques used by Pollock while painting this masterpiece. Combining the knowledge of the curators and the metric data gathered in the digitization, we were able to discover and validate several interesting aspects of the painting, in the direction of trying to better understanding the painting process which was, in the idea of the artist, an essential part of the artwork. The 3D model of the artwork played a central role also in the temporary exhibition created for the dissemination of the conservation and the diagnostic campaign to the museum visitors. This was also done following the idea of using the geometry to explain the gestures, actions and techniques of Jackson Pollock at work. The 3D model was used to create an interactive kiosk, to have the visitors navigate the model and access explanations of relevant geometrical details and to produce a 1:1 physical reproduction to give the public the possibility to physically interact with the artwork.","tags":["Digital Heritage"],"title":"Alchemy in 3D – A Digitization for a Journey Through Matter","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eliana Siotto","Gianpaolo Palma","Marco Potenziani","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1443657600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443657600,"objectID":"b9db629fe8265ddef73228d5f1b3b668","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2015/SPPS15/","publishdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015/SPPS15/","section":"publication","summary":"Greek and Roman marble artworks have been deeply studied from a typological and stylistic point of view, while there is still a limited knowledge on the pigments, dyes, binders and technical expedients used by Roman artists. In a renewed scientific interest towards the ancient polychromy (colour and gilding), a digital methodological and multidisciplinary approach can provide valuable information to better investigate and understand this fundamental aspect and to get a complete sense on Greek and Roman marble artworks. Following this research direction, the paper proposes a systematic methodological process defined to detect, document and visualize the preserved (and in some cases the digital reconstructed) original colour and gilding on Roman marble sarcophagi (II-IV century AD). The process defines a working pipeline that, starting from the selection of the artefact to study, proposes a set of investigation steps to improve our knowledge of its original painting. These steps include the direct virtual inspection, the archaeological and historical research, the on-site scientific investigation by multispectral imaging, spectroscopic and elemental analysis (eventually supported by micro-invasive techniques performed in laboratory), the accurate polychrome surface acquisition by colour calibrated 2D images. All the data produced are integrated with a high-resolution 3D model to support enhanced analysis and comparison and to create a digital 3D polychrome reconstruction by virtual painting. Finally, all those data are also made accessible on the web by using a cutting edge platform for visual media publication and interactive 3D visualization. This systematic and multidisciplinary process was tested on the so-called \"Annona sarcophagus\" (Museo Nazionale Romano - Palazzo Massimo, inv. no. 40799).","tags":["Digital Heritage"],"title":"Digital Study and Web - based Documentation of the Colour and Gilding on  Ancient Marble Artworks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrea Baldacci","Daniele Bernabei","Fabio Ganovelli","Massimiliano Corsini","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"628ed99728c36374db7654f318d2c940","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2015/BBGCS15/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015/BBGCS15/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a novel interactive framework for improving 3D reconstruction starting from incomplete or noisy results obtained through image-based reconstruction algorithms.

Our full pipeline executes instantly (less than a second) on meshes with hundreds of thousands of faces, enabling new types of interactive workflows. Since our algorithm avoids any global optimization, and its key steps scale linearly with input size, we are able to process extremely large meshes and point clouds, with sizes exceeding several hundred million elements. To demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our method, we apply it to hundreds of models of varying complexity and provide our cross-platform reference implementation in the supplemental material.

While a range of methods exist for discretizing 3D objects with an initial topologically suitable hex mesh, their output meshes frequently contain poorly shaped and even inverted elements, requiring a further quality optimization step. We introduce a novel framework for optimizing hex-mesh quality capable of generating inversion-free high-quality meshes from such poor initial inputs. We recast hex quality improvement as an optimization of the shape of overlapping cones, or unions, of tetrahedra surrounding every directed edge in the hex mesh, and show the two to be equivalent. We then formulate cone shape optimization as a sequence of convex quadratic optimization problems, where hex convexity is encoded via simple linear inequality constraints. As this solution space may be empty, we therefore present an alternate formulation which allows the solver to proceed even when constraints cannot be satisfied exactly. We iteratively improve mesh element quality by solving at each step a set of local, per-cone, convex constrained optimization problems, followed by a global energy minimization step which reconciles these local solutions. This latter method provides no theoretical guarantees on the solution but produces inversion-free, high quality meshes in practice. We demonstrate the robustness of our framework by optimizing numerous poor quality input meshes generated using a variety of initial meshing methods and producing high-quality inversion-free meshes in each case. We further validate our algorithm by comparing it against previous work, and demonstrate a significant improvement in both worst and average element quality.\n\n[ project page ] [ Video ]","tags":null,"title":"Practical Hex-Mesh Optimization via Edge-Cone Rectification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Callieri","Matteo Dellepiane","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"a36fee7d72312a985c48e5768402e0ae","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2015/CDS15/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015/CDS15/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Remote visualization and navigation of 3D models of archeological sites","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Silvia Biasotti","Andrea Cerri","Masaki Aono","A.

However, in the real world, the same basic function of applying colors onto an object is far from trivial. One can specify colors during the fabrication process using a color 3D printer, but this does not apply to already existing objects. Paint and decals can be used during post-fabrication, but they are challenging to apply on complex shapes. In this paper, we develop a method to enable texture mapping of physical objects, that is, we allow one to map an arbitrary color image onto a three-dimensional object. Our approach builds upon hydrographics, a technique to transfer pigments printed on a sheet of polymer onto curved surfaces. We first describe a setup that makes the traditional water transfer printing process more accurate and consistent across prints. We then simulate the transfer process using a specialized parameterization to estimate the mapping between the planar color map and the object surface. We demonstrate that our approach enables the application of detailed color maps onto complex shapes such as 3D models of faces and anatomical casts.","tags":null,"title":"Texture Mapping Real-World Objects with Hydrographics ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chiara Leoni","Marco Callieri","Matteo Dellepiane","Daniel O Donnell","Roberto Rosselli Del Turco","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"42441df376570f7a61dedf8bee7ce521","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2015/LCDORS15/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015/LCDORS15/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"The Dream and the Cross: A 3D Scanning Project to Bring 3D Content in a Digital Edition","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"VirtualTour is a virtual reality app for iOS 8 supporting the easy and natural exploration of cultural heritage sites captured with 3D scanning technologies or modeled by artists.

Our GPU-accelerated unattended construction pipeline distributes probes so as to guarantee coverage of the scene while accounting for perceptual criteria before finding smooth, good looking paths between neighboring probes. Images and videos are precomputed at construction time with off-line photorealistic rendering engines, providing a convincing 3D visualization beyond the limits of current real-time graphics techniques. At run-time, the graph is exploited both for creating automatic scene indexes and movie previews of complex scenes and for supporting interactive exploration through a low-DOF assisted navigation interface and the visual indexing of the scene provided by the selected viewpoints. Due to negligible CPU overhead and very limited use of GPU functionality, real-time performance is achieved on emerging web-based environments based on WebGL even on low-powered mobile devices.","tags":null,"title":"eXploreMaps: Efficient Construction and Ubiquitous Exploration of Panoramic View Graphcs of Complex 3D Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paolo Cignoni","Nico Pietroni","Luigi Malomo","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" Talk Slides ","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"821171018041d7b9fc7d8b823e0ec447","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2014/CPMS14/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014/CPMS14/","section":"publication","summary":"Mesh joinery is an innovative method to produce illustrative shape approxi- mations suitable for fabrication.

The pieces are designed so that they can be represented as a simple height field and, therefore, they can be manufactured by common 3D printers without the usage of supporting material. The removal of the supporting material is often a burdensome task and may eventually damage the surface of the printed object. Our approach makes the final reproduction cheaper, accurate and suitable for the reproduction of tangible cultural heritages. Moreover, since the proposed technique decomposes the artwork in pieces, it also overcomes the working space limits of common printers. The decomposition of the input (high-resolution) triangular mesh is driven by a coarse polygonal base mesh (representing the target subdivision in pieces); the height fields defining each piece are generated by sampling distances along the normal of each face composing the base mesh. A innovative interlocking mechanism allows adjacent pieces to plug each other to compose the final shape. This interlocking mechanism is designed to preserve the height field property of the pieces and to provide a sufficient degree of grip to ensure the assembled structure shape to be compact and stable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show its limitations with some practical reproduction examples.

The singulari- ties of the parametrization in general agree with singularities of the field, except in a small number of cases when several additional cones need to be added in a controlled way. Parametric lines can be constrained to follow an arbitrary set of feature lines on the surface. Our method is based on constructing an initial quad patch partition using robust cross-field integral line tracing. This process is fol- lowed by an algorithm modifying the quad layout structure to en- sure that consistent parametric lengths can be assigned to the edges. For most meshes, the layout modification algorithm does not add new singularities; a small number of singularities may be added to resolve an explicitly described set of layouts. We demonstrate that our algorithm succeeds on a test data set of over a hundred meshes.                        talk Slides                                              Here the results of our experiments:                        Input data for our experiments                                                Results of MIQ                                                Results for BD                                                 Results for IGM                                                Our Results","tags":null,"title":"Robust Field-aligned Global Parametrization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabrizio Costantino","Simone Durazzani","Daniele Poggi","Marco Callieri","Matteo Dellepiane","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"ddf08df98eee02abb23909edd54d24e4","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2014/CDPCDS14/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014/CDPCDS14/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"San Leonardo in Arcetri: innovazione tecnologica per la gestione integrata dei beni culturali","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mara De Matteis","Matteo Dellepiane"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"27c6ea9cded641f05d4b2c27acf02e0a","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2014/DD14/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014/DD14/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Site-specific Art and 3D: an Example of Spatial Analysis and Reconstruction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrea Baldacci","Fabio Ganovelli","Massimiliano Corsini","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"1ef5c9e58ca3bc5b6580f4dfe9c67f45","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2014/BGCS14/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014/BGCS14/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Stereo-browsing from Calibrated Cameras","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianpaolo Palma","Monica Baldassarri","Maria Chiara Favilla","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"0e73aa13149bc82fa14f3b77257bf361","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2014/PBFS14/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014/PBFS14/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Storytelling of a Coin Collection by Means of RTI Images: the Case of the Simoneschi Collection in Palazzo Blu","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"This activity was carried out in the framework of the ArTeSalVa project, financed in the line POR-FSE 2007-2013 of Regione Toscana, involving the LARTTE laboratory of Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa and the Visual Computing Lab of ISTI-CNR.

Our purpose is therefore to design a flexible interactive system, based on the selection of a set of constraints which relates different fragments, according to the understanding and experience of the CH operator. Once the user has defined those constraints, the system searches for a suitable solution, using a global energy minimization strategy that considers simultaneously all the pieces involved in the reconstruction process. Additionally, our framework provides the possibility to work in a hierarchical way, mimicking the traditional physical procedure that archaeologists use to reassemble tangible fractured objects. The frameworks is designed to work even with fragments that could have been severely damaged or eroded. On those datasets, automatic approaches may often fail, since the fractured regions do not contain enough geometric information to infer the correct matches.

We analyze an input sequence of meshes with point-to-point correspondence, and we automatically produce a quadrangular mesh that fits well the input animation. We first analyze the local deformation that the surface undergoes at each point, and we initialize a cross field that remains as aligned as possible to the principal directions of deformation throughout the sequence. We then smooth this cross field based on an energy that uses a weighted combination of the initial field and the local amount of stretch. Finally, we compute a field-aligned quadrangulation with an off-the-shelf method. Our technique is fast and very simple to implement, and it significantly improves the quality of the output quad mesh and its suitability for character animation, compared to creating the quad mesh based on a single pose.

When compared to the sole use of the distant illumination, the added spatial information better reproduces a variety of local effects such as shadows, highlights and caustics. Without the effort needed to create precise scene reconstructions, EnvyDepth annotations take only tens of seconds to produce a plausible lighting without visible artifacts.

The employed embedding strategy is based on a decomposition of the original HDR representation into multiple low dynamic range (LDR) images by means of a bracketing process. After having inserted the selected watermark into each LDR component, the final output is generated by combining the available contributions into a single HDR object. By exploiting some of the well studied properties of digital watermarking for standard LDR images, our approach is able to generate a watermarked HDR image visually equivalent to the original one, while allowing to detect the embedded information in both the marked HDR image and in its LDR counterpart, obtained through tone-mapping operators or by extracting a specific luminance range of interest from it. Several results obtained from an extensive set of experimental tests are reported to testify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","tags":null,"title":"HDR Image Watermarking based on Bracketing Decomposition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucia Arbace","Sonnino Elisabetta","Marco Callieri","Matteo Dellepiane","M.

In this peculiar context is very important to share the same, large data in a  web-based environment, accessing it through portable devices. Here it has to be visualized using simple and immediate interfaces, since the specific end-users are not necessary  skilled with virtual reality and 3D objects interaction. The dataset itself is not static as well as in general purpose web based  3D browsers, but dynamic and changing during the evolution of the real or simulated crisis. According with these constraints, we propose a system which simplifies location recognition and visualizes dynamically updated pictorial data inside a virtual 3D environment.  Our system is integrated in a more complex and articulated training and decision framework for emergency operations.  3DNSITE implements a novel aided intuitive interface designed to exploit touchscreen devices to  easily navigate between 3D aligned photographs.  Unlike common popular 3D maps browsers, the free 3D navigation through the whole 3D model is always  supported, assuring an interactive representation of the scenario also when no photo is available. 3DNSITE enhances already presented state-of-the-art methods for managing the data, achieving  an excellent scalability on portable devices in terms of both performance and amount of data.  The system also scales over different devices according to their hardware resources and the  available network bandwidth, exploiting a state-of-the-art multiresolution representation for  the 3D model and a multi-level cache system, employed to web access both the images and  the hierarchical 3D model structure.","tags":null,"title":"3DNSITE: A NETWORKED INTERACTIVE 3D VISUALIZATION SYSTEM TO SIMPLIFY LOCATION RECOGNITION IN CRISIS MANAGEMENT","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Banterle","Massimiliano Corsini","Paolo Cignoni","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"link to the official journal\nPiccante\nOpenGL ES 2.0 shaders source code and data\n","date":1325376e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376e3,"objectID":"3b401df10c6955ad82f2f313f87a1284","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2012/BCCS12/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012/BCCS12/","section":"publication","summary":"abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfunction log(msg) { var textarea = document.getElementById(\"log-area\");

(A vertex seam is a vertex duplication of a polygonal mesh with different texture coordinates assigned to the two geometrically coinciding copies.) As a result, the method leads to simpler, leaner, replication-free data structures. Is also allows for a higher degree of proceduralism in generation of texture coordinates. The method is general, trivial to implement (exhaustive pseudocode is provided), very low in cost on resources (with a virtually null impact on performance), and it leverages only basic mechanisms widely available in most GPU implementations.

The retarget display has different features from the target one such as: dynamic range, discretization levels, color gamut, multi-view (3D), refresh rate, spatial resolution... This is a very relevant and hot topic in graphics, given the increasing number of display devices, from large, high-contrast screens to small cell phones with limited dynamic range; a lot of techniques are being published in different venues, and it's simply very hard to keep up.   For instance, one of the few cases for which retargeting can be potentially straightforward is when adapting images from a larger display (in term of resolution) to a smaller one with the same aspect ratio: a low-pass filter followed by downsampling can then achieve good quality results. However, for most cases retargeting can be an ill-posed problem, such as when displaying Low Dynamic Range (LDR) or 8-bit content on High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays. Such a problem requires the retargeting algorithm to generate new content which is missing in the input image/frame.   In this course, we will present the latest solutions and techniques for retargeting images along various dimensions such as dynamic range, colors, temporal and spatial resolutions, and offer for the first time a much-needed holistic view of the field. Moreover, we are going to show how to measure and analyze the changes applied to an image/video in terms of quality using both (subjective) psychophysical experiments and (objective) computational metrics.    The course should be of interest to anyone involved in graphics in its broader sense, given the almost unavoidable need to retarget results to different devices: from developer that are interested to implement retargeting techniques, to users that just need an overall perspective, for researchers fully engaged in developing multi-dimensional retargeting techniques, for whom this course will serve as a solid background for future algorithms.\n\n\n\nSyllabus:\nIntroduction by Francesco Banterle Dynamic Range Retargeting: Tone Mapping by Rafal Mantiuk Dynamic Range Retargeting: Cornsweet Illusion and Glare in Tone Mapping by Tobias Ritschel Dynamic Range Retargeting: The Color Issue by Alessandro Artusi Dynamic Range Retargeting: Reverse/Inverse Tone Mapping by Francesco Banterle Spatial Image Retargeting by Diego Gutierrez Temporal Image Retargeting by Elmar Eisemann and Tobias Ritschel Quality Metrics by Tunc Aydin Stereo Retargeting by Piotr Didyk","tags":null,"title":"Mapping images to target devices: spatial, temporal, stereo, tone, and color","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabio Ganovelli","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1325376e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376e3,"objectID":"82a850a33c4471b725636ebd0053e540","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2012/GS12/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012/GS12/","section":"publication","summary":"OCME (Out-of-Core Mesh Editing) is a novel data-structure  and related algorithms for out-of-core editing of large meshes.

The viewer supports the interaction with the RTI image through a set of functionalities: changing the light direction; zooming; panning over the image; flipping the coin; visualizing hot spots, which link specific areas on the coin with descriptive HTML hypertext.","tags":null,"title":"Telling The Story Of Ancient Coins By Means Of Interactive RTI Images Visualization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sabrina Batino","Marco Callieri","Daniele Duranti","Matteo Dellepiane","Paolo Pingi","Eliana Siotto","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1325376e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376e3,"objectID":"8df80bb1f3f7b5c2ea6616e214b0e8c0","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2012/BCDDPSS12/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012/BCDDPSS12/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Virtual Reconstruction of an Etruscan Tomb","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Scopigno","Marco Callieri","Paolo Cignoni","Massimiliano Corsini","Matteo Dellepiane","Federico Ponchio","Guido Ranzuglia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":129384e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":129384e4,"objectID":"3fb8940bcfac74edb84df705a0563f25","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2011/SCCCDPR11/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011/SCCCDPR11/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"3D models for Cultural Heritage: beyond plain visualization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniele Bernabei","Fabio Ganovelli","Marco Di Benedetto","Matteo Dellepiane","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":129384e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":129384e4,"objectID":"0998f5f084459d5555ef3da0dc26e68f","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2011/BGDDS11/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011/BGDDS11/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A Low-Cost Time-Critical Obstacle Avoidance System for the Visually Impaired","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ruggero Pintus","Enrico Gobbetti","Marco Callieri"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":129384e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":129384e4,"objectID":"3501d7c9a39ee83d1dd6f9ab7ae759c9","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2011/PGC11/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011/PGC11/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A Streaming Framework for Seamless Detailed Photo Blending on Massive Point Clouds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alessandro Artusi","Francesco Banterle","Dmitry  Chetverikov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":129384e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":129384e4,"objectID":"6faf8565b369b097bd20baa7288d734c","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2011/ABC11/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011/ABC11/","section":"publication","summary":"abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstractIn the real world, materials often show both diffuse and specular reflections. To separate these two reflection components may help applications which need consistent object surface appearance. In fact, many algorithms used in numerous tasks of computer vision, computer graphics and image processing,  work under the assumption of perfect Lambertian surfaces (or perfect diffuse reflection). They consider specular pixels (or highlights) as outliers or noise. Moreover, the two reflection components can be processed separately and afterwards recombined to produce particular visual effects [MZK*06] (dichromatic editing  Figure.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Example of an image where the presence of highlights generates the loss of details and colour information. Details and colours are completely washed out in the highlights region.\n\n\n\nSeveral specularity removal techniques are available in literature; they differ in the information they use and in how it is used. Table 1 summarises how these techniques may be classified and in which paragraph of this survey they are explained. The notation used in Table 1 for the categories is the following: CSA, colour space analysis; NA, neighbourhood analysis; POL, polarization; IS, image sequences; MFI, multiple-flash images. The notation used in Table 1 for the techniques is the following: CRM, using colour reflection model [KSK87, KSK88]; TDA, 2D diagram approach [ST95b, SK00]; BM, Bajcsy et al. method [BLL96]; USFI, use of specular-free images [TI05b, YCK06, SC09]; PDE, PDE approach [MZK*06]; IT, in-panting technique [TLQ06]; CC, use of colour information and classifier [TFA05]; TS, separation of highlight reflections on textured surfaces [TLQ06]; FR, Fresnel methods [Ang07]; HM, histogram methods [CGS06]; HFLF, high-low frequency separation [LPD07, NGR06]; MBS, multi-baseline-stereo [LB92, LYK*03, LS01]; MII, deriving intrinsic images from image sequences with illumination changes [Wei01]; CP, colour and polarisation methods [NFB97, KLHS02, MPC*07, USGG04]; MF, multi-flash methods [FRTT04, ARNL05].\n\n\nTable 1: The classification of highlights removal methods.

Computing such global seamless parameterization makes it possible to perform quad remeshing, texture mapping and texture  synthesis and many other types of geometry processing operations. Our approach is based on a formulation of the Poisson equation on a manifold structure defined for the surface by the range images. Construction of such global parameterization requires only a way to project surface data onto a set of planes, and can be applied directly to implicit surfaces, nonmanifold surfaces, very large meshes,  and collections of range scans.

The retarget display has different features from the target one such as: dynamic range, discretization levels, color gamut, multi-view (3D), refresh rate, spatial resolution... This is a very relevant and hot topic in graphics, given the increasing number of display devices, from large, high-contrast screens to small cell phones with limited dynamic range; a lot of techniques are being published in different venues, and it's simply very hard to keep up.   For instance, one of the few cases for which retargeting can be potentially straightforward is when adapting images from a larger display (in term of resolution) to a smaller one with the same aspect ratio: a low-pass filter followed by downsampling can then achieve good quality results. However, for most cases retargeting can be an ill-posed problem, such as when displaying Low Dynamic Range (LDR) or 8-bit content on High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays. Such a problem requires the retargeting algorithm to generate new content which is missing in the input image/frame.   In this course, we will present the latest solutions and techniques for retargeting images along various dimensions such as dynamic range, colors, temporal and spatial resolutions, and offer for the first time a much-needed holistic view of the field. Moreover, we are going to show how to measure and analyze the changes applied to an image/video in terms of quality using both (subjective) psychophysical experiments and (objective) computational metrics.    The course should be of interest to anyone involved in graphics in its broader sense, given the almost unavoidable need to retarget results to different devices: from developer that are interested to implement retargeting techniques, to users that just need an overall perspective, for researchers fully engaged in developing multi-dimensional retargeting techniques, for whom this course will serve as a solid background for future algorithms.\n\n\n\nSyllabus:\nIntroduction by Francesco Banterle Dynamic Range Retargeting: Tone Mapping by Rafal Mantiuk Dynamic Range Retargeting: Cornsweet Illusion and Glare in Tone Mapping by Karol Myszkowski Dynamic Range Retargeting: The Color Issue by Alessandro Artusi Dynamic Range Retargeting: Reverse/Inverse Tone Mapping by Francesco Banterle Spatial Image Retargeting by Diego Gutierrez Temporal Image Retargeting by Elmar Eisemann and Karol Myszkowski Quality Metrics by Tunc Aydin Stereo Retargeting by Piotr Didyk","tags":null,"title":"Multidimensional Image Retargeting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Callieri","Antoni Chica","Matteo Dellepiane","Isaac Besora","Massimiliano Corsini","Jordi Moyés","Guido Ranzuglia","Roberto Scopigno","Pere Brunet"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":129384e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":129384e4,"objectID":"61108a340a595de649ffde920fbe2c88","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2011/CCDBCMRSB11/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011/CCDBCMRSB11/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Multiscale acquisition and presentation of very large artifacts: The case of Portalada","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Franco Mosca","Andrea Pietrabissa","Fabio Ganovelli","Giuseppe Megali","Nico Pietroni","Giuseppe Turini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":129384e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":129384e4,"objectID":"59371c4dd55001ee3183d08e6d5bf327","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2011/TPMGPM11/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011/TPMGPM11/","section":"publication","summary":"In the recent decades robotics and computer science have been  gaining more and more relevance in all aspects of our lives. In surgery, for  example, they gave birth to procedures, impossible to perform otherwise, like  the tele-surgery or the nano-surgery. On this regard, these applied sciences  already play an important role in assisting the surgeon both in the operative  room and, as a support, in the education of young surgeons, but much work has  still to be done.  In fact in these last years we have seen an extreme change in the traditional  training in surgery and the computer-based simulation is one of the main reason  of this shift. The spread of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) has brought  major improvements in the quality of healthcare, but it has also increased the  complexity of the surgical procedures requiring advanced and highly  specialized training systems. Moreover these training procedures need to be  reiterated during the operational life of surgeons. Therefore, considering the  limited availability of cadavers and the public concern with the non-ethical  treatment of animals, the traditional approaches to surgical training are  drastically limited encouraging the use of surgical simulators based on virtual  environments.  Healthcare industries and the scientific community in medicine agree  indicating the disruptive potential of the application of Virtual Reality (VR) to  the training in the medical field. Therefore the next step is the development of  surgical simulators with an high level of realism in order to practice complex  procedures in a safe environment. Moreover it is decisive that this evolution is  done integrating advanced medical imaging and processing, allowing surgeons  to practice simulated interventions on patient specific dataset.  The increasing importance of MIS techniques will cause a drastic change in  pre-operation planning and basic surgical training. In fact, the features of this  kind of surgical approach (the workspace limitation, the 2D vision through a  laparoscopic camera and the indirect physical interaction with the patient body)  make it possible to use a surgical simulator to train, plan or simulate an  intervention, reproducing the visual and tactile feedback of the real surgical  procedure on a real patient.  This paper presents some research and applicative results on Computer  Assisted Surgery (CAS) achieved in the framework of EndoCAS, a newly  founded Center of Excellence in Pisa.

A key aspect is the choice of the rendering process to correlate the 3D model to the image without taking into account the texture data and the lighting conditions. Even if several rendering types for the 3D model have been analyzed, in some cases the alignment fails for two main reasons: the peculiar reflection behavior of the object that we are not able to reproduce in the rendering of the 3D model without knowing the material characteristics of the object and the lighting conditions of the acquisition environment; the characteristics of the image background, especially non uniform background,that can degrade the convergence of the registration. To improve the quality of the registration in these cases we propose to compute the MI between the gradient map of the 3D rendering and the gradient map of the image in order to maximize the shared data between them.","tags":null,"title":"Improving 2D-3D registration by mutual information using gradient maps","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guillaume Lavoué","Massimiliano Corsini"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1262304e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304e3,"objectID":"70b0bf61ac43c2ea1c947e97cfcc7cc0","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2010/LC10/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2010/LC10/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"A Comparison of Perceptually-Based Metrics for Objective Evaluation of Geometry Processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matteo Dellepiane","Paolo Cignoni","Marco Tarini","Fabio Ganovelli","Davide Portelli","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1262304e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304e3,"objectID":"ee49dd120782722bdb9781d8c7e22fa1","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2010/PGTCDS10/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2010/PGTCDS10/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"A framework for User-Assisted Sketch-Based Fitting of Geometric Primitives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Agostino Bozzo","Daniele Panozzo","Enrico Puppo","Nico Pietroni","Luigi Rocca"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304e3,"objectID":"77bcfdd03b2ec86c94f0801e9753dd73","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2010/BPPPR10/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2010/BPPPR10/","section":"publication","summary":"We present an improved algorithm for the progressive simplification of quad meshes, which adapts the resolution of the mesh to details of the modeled shape.

The domain is a collection of equilateral triangular 2D regions enriched with explicit adjacency relationships (it is abstract in the sense that no 3D embedding is necessary). It is tailored to minimize isometric distor tion, resulting in excellent parameterization qualities, even when meshes with complex shape and topology are mapped into domains composed of a small number of large continuous regions. Moreover, this domain is in turn remapped into a collection of 2D square regions, unlocking many advantages found in quad-based domains (e.g. ease of packing).

However, this approach does not scale well with the size of the datasets (number of images). In this paper, we propose a new thumbnail-based interface to browse large collections of images. Our approach is based on weighted centroidal anisotropic Voronoi diagrams. A dynamically changing subset of images is represented by thumbnails and shown on the screen. Thumbnails are shaped like general polygons, to better cover screen space, while still reflecting the original aspect ratios or orientation of the represented images. During the browsing process, thumbnails are dynamically rearranged, reshaped and rescaled. The objective is to devote more screen space (more numerous and larger thumbnails) to the parts of the dataset closer to the current region of interest, and progressively lesser away from it, while still making the dataset visible as a whole. During the entire process, temporal coherence is always maintained.

A number of recent algorithms for conversion of arbitrary meshes to regularly sampled form (typically quadrangulation) aim to align the resulting mesh with feature lines of the geometry. While resulting in a substantial improvement in mesh quality, feature alignment makes it difficult to obtain coarse regular patch partitions of the mesh. In this paper, we propose an approach to constructing patch layouts consisting of small numbers of quadrilateral patches while maintaining good feature alignment. To achieve this, we use quadrilateral T-meshes, for which the intersection of two faces may not be the whole edge or vertex, but a part of an edge. T-meshes offer more flexibility for reduction of the number of patches and vertices in a base domain while maintaining alignment with geometric features. At the same time, T-meshes retain many desirable features of quadrangulations, allowing construction of high-order representations, easy packing of regularly sampled geometric data into textures, as well as supporting different types of discretizations for physical simulation.\nTalk Slides","tags":null,"title":"Feature-aligned T-meshes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianpaolo Palma","Marco Callieri","Matteo Dellepiane","Massimiliano Corsini","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304e3,"objectID":"cca15e4a9641aeb096303ac5998f2c66","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2010/PCDCS10/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2010/PCDCS10/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a new method for the accurate registration of video sequences of a real object over its dense triangular mesh.

Solid textures are an efficient instrument to compactly represent both the external and internal appearance of 3D objects, providing practical advantages with respect to classical 2D texturing. Recently, several methods have been proposed to synthesize solid textures. For some of those, which are commonly referred as procedural, colors are obtained by means of functions that algorithmically encode appearance and structure properties of the texture. Alternatively, example-based methods aim to capture and replicate the appearance as described by a set of input exemplars. Within this framework, we propose a novel classification of solid texture synthesis methods: boundary-independent and boundarydependent methods. In the case of boundary-independent methods, the shape of the object to be textured is irrelevant and texture information can be freely generated for each point in the space. Conversely, boundary-dependent methods conform the synthesis process to the actual shape of the object, so that they can exploit this information to orient and guide the texture generation. For better understanding the different algorithms proposed in the literature, we first provide a short introduction on 2D texture synthesis methods, focusing on the main principles which are also exploited for 3D texture synthesis. We review the different methodologies by considering their strengths and weaknesses, the class of appearances they can successfully synthesize, and failure cases. In particular, we focus our attention on advantages and drawbacks of boundary-independent methods with respect to boundary-dependent ones.\nThis PDF contains the Author version, you can downlaod the

paper presents the Splitting Cubes, a fast and robust technique to perform interactive virtual cutting on deformable ob jects.  The technique relies on two ideas. The Þrst one is to embed the deformable ob ject in a regular grid,  to apply the deformation function to the grid nodes and to interpolate the deformation inside each cell from its 8 nodes. The second idea is to produce a tessellation for the boundary of the ob ject on the base  of the intersections of such boundary with the edges of the grid. Please note that the boundary can be  expressed in any way, for example it can be a triangle mesh, an implicit or a parametric surface. The only requirement is that the intersection between the boundary and the grid edges can be computed.  This paper shows how the interpolation of the deformation inside the cells can be used to produce  discontinuities in the deformation function, and the intersections of the cut surface can be used to  visually show the cuts on the object. The Splitting Cubes is essentially a tessellation algorithm for growing, deformable surface and it can be applied to any method for animating deformable ob jects. In this paper the case of the mesh-free methods (MMs) is considered: in this context, we decribed a practical GPU friendly method, that we named the Extended Visibility criterion, to introduce discontinuities of the deformation.","tags":null,"title":"Splitting Cubes a Fast and Robust technique for Virtual Cutting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Denis Pitzalis","Paolo Cignoni","M.

fidelity and interactivity are the main goals in Computer Graphics research, but recently also audio is assuming an important role. Binaural rendering can provide extremely pleasing and realistic three-dimensional sound, but to achieve best results it's necessary either to measure or to estimate individual Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF). This function is strictly related to the peculiar features of ears and face of the listener. Recent sound scattering simulation techniques can calculate HRTF starting from an accurate 3D model of a human head. Hence, the use of binaural rendering on large scale (i.e. video games, entertainment) could depend on the possibility to produce a sufficiently accurate 3D model of a human head, starting from the smallest possible input. In this paper we present a completely automatic system, which produces a 3D model of a head starting from simple input data (five photos and some key-points indicated by user). The geometry is generated by extracting information from images and accordingly deforming a 3D dummy to reproduce user head features.

In surgery, for  example, they gave birth to procedures, impossible to perform otherwise, like  the tele-surgery or the nano-surgery. On this regard, these applied sciences  already play an important role in assisting the surgeon both in the operative  room and, as a support, in the education of young surgeons, but much work has  still to be done.  In fact in these last years we have seen an extreme change in the traditional  training in surgery and the computer-based simulation is one of the main reason  of this shift. The spread of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) has brought  major improvements in the quality of healthcare, but it has also increased the  complexity of the surgical procedures requiring advanced and highly  specialized training systems. Moreover these training procedures need to be  reiterated during the operational life of surgeons. Therefore, considering the  limited availability of cadavers and the public concern with the non-ethical  treatment of animals, the traditional approaches to surgical training are  drastically limited encouraging the use of surgical simulators based on virtual  environments.  Healthcare industries and the scientific community in medicine agree  indicating the disruptive potential of the application of Virtual Reality (VR) to  the training in the medical field. Therefore the next step is the development of  surgical simulators with an high level of realism in order to practice complex  procedures in a safe environment. Moreover it is decisive that this evolution is  done integrating advanced medical imaging and processing, allowing surgeons  to practice simulated interventions on patient specific dataset.  The increasing importance of MIS techniques will cause a drastic change in  pre-operation planning and basic surgical training. In fact, the features of this  kind of surgical approach (the workspace limitation, the 2D vision through a  laparoscopic camera and the indirect physical interaction with the patient body)  make it possible to use a surgical simulator to train, plan or simulate an  intervention, reproducing the visual and tactile feedback of the real surgical  procedure on a real patient.  This paper presents some research and applicative results on Computer  Assisted Surgery (CAS) achieved in the framework of EndoCAS, a newly  founded Center of Excellence in Pisa. The research has involved: the  development of segmentation algorithms for volumetric datasets, the simulation  of bone drilling procedures, the modeling of deformable object cuts and  deformations and the simulation of rope interactions during a suture procedure  in MIS. All these projects were been developed using a new open source library  to support the implementation of techniques for simulating deformable objects.  Our purpose is to enhance the surgical training with new improved  techniques applied both to the medical imaging and to the computer-based  simulation in order to carry the surgical training to a next level of realism.","tags":null,"title":"New techniques for computer-based simulation in surgical training","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valentino Fiorin","Paolo Cignoni","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"ca01f0d8dab53cb78e1b4f4826ce0b11","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2007/FCS07/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2007/FCS07/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Out-of-core MLS reconstruction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"f9430a922069dd0aff9aeaf13d2f42fc","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2007/Sco07/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2007/Sco07/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Processing methodologies and interactive visualization of 3D scanned architectures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paolo Cignoni","Marco Di Benedetto","Fabio Ganovelli","Enrico Gobbetti","Fabio Marton","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"c373384c28b002034685afd4317f3096","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2007/CDGGMS07/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2007/CDGGMS07/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Ray-Casted BlockMaps for Large Urban Models Streaming and Visualization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giuseppe Turini","Nico Pietroni","Fabio Ganovelli","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"49654bd1fa7387041f2e828599f76582","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2007/TPGS07/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2007/TPGS07/","section":"publication","summary":"In the recent decades robotic and computer science have been gaining more and more relevance in all aspects of our lives.

When the internal surfaces of the 3D model are revealed as it is cut, carved, or simply clipped, we synthesize their texture from the input photographs. Our texture synthesis algorithm is best classified as a morphing technique, which efficiently outputs the texture attributes of each surface point on demand. For determining source points and their weights in the morphing algorithm, we propose an interpolation domain based on BSP trees that naturally resembles planar splitting of real objects. In the context of the interpolation domain, we define efficient warping and morphing operations that allow for real-time synthesis of textures. Overall, our modeling paradigm, together with its realization through our texture synthesis algorithm, allow users to author 3D models that reveal highly realistic internal surfaces in a variety of artistic flavors.\nTalk Slides","tags":null,"title":"Texturing Internal Surfaces from a Few Cross Sections","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matteo Dellepiane","Marco Callieri","Mark Fondersmith","Paolo Cignoni","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"d9eb78f83030eb2120ec1de50ece3c8b","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2007/DCFCS07/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2007/DCFCS07/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Using 3D scanning to analyze a proposal for the attribution of a bronze horse to Leonardo da Vinci","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michele Brunetti","Marco Callieri","Benedetto Pizzo","Claudio Montani","Paolo Pingi","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"d4266ccc0f3c59ad836a4e17c389a310","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2007/BCPMPS07/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2007/BCPMPS07/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Using 3D scanning to monitor wood deformations and to evaluate preservation strategies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Massimiliano Corsini","Elisa Drelie Gelasca","Touradj Ebrahimi","Mauro Barni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"9221b9839e1b6aa1575d31a8cc93ca61","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2007/CDEB07/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2007/CDEB07/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Watermarked 3D Mesh Quality Assessment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Callieri","Paul Debevec","Jarrel Pair","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"c366fe9baa02e40f19542f5835341820","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2006/CDPS06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2006/CDPS06/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A realtime immersive application with realistic lighting: the Parthenon","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Tarini","Paolo Cignoni","Claudio Montani"],"categories":null,"content":" QuteMol\nqutemol.sourceforge.net\n","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"2cfabf3154c670ac7ccc6ecc39221779","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2006/TCM06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2006/TCM06/","section":"publication","summary":"The paper presents a set of combined techniques to enhance the real-time visualization of simple or complex molecules (up to order of $10^6$ atoms) space fill mode.

The technique, called Compressed Batched Dynamic Adaptive Meshes (C-BDAM), is an extension of the BDAM and P-BDAM chunked level-of-detail hierarchy. In the C-BDAM approach, all patches share the same regular triangulation connectivity and incrementally encode their vertex attributes using a quantized representation of the difference with respect to values predicted from the coarser level. The structure provides a number of benefits: simplicity of data structures, overall geometric continuity for planar and spherical domains, support for variable resolution input data, management of multiple vertex attributes, efficient compression and fast construction times, ability to support maximum-error metrics, real-time decompression and shaded rendering with configurable variable level-of-detail extraction, and runtime detail synthesis. The efficiency of the approach and the achieved compression rates are demonstrated on a number of test cases, including the interactive visualization of a 29 gigasample reconstruction of the whole planet Earth created from high resolution SRTM data.","tags":null,"title":"C-BDAM - Compressed Batched Dynamic Adaptive Meshes for Terrain Rendering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Callieri","Federico Ponchio","Paolo Cignoni","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"679298db72b1da05129e6dd1a6c5849f","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2006/CPCS06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2006/CPCS06/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Easy Access to Huge 3D Models of Works of Art","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Scopigno","Marco Callieri","Massimiliano Corsini","Matteo Dellepiane"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"4a56720bc75f6e7ab41fb51799cb7e8d","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2006/DCCS06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2006/DCCS06/","section":"publication","summary":"Reflection Transformation Imaging has proved to be a powerful method to acquire and represent the 3D reflectance properties of an object, displaying them as a 2D image. Recently, Polynomial Texture Maps (PTM), which are relightable images created from a set of photos of the object taken under several different lighting conditions, have been used in Cultural Heritage field to document and virtually inspect several sets of small objects, such as cuneiform tablets and coins. In this paper we explore the possibility of producing high quality PTM of medium or large size objects. The aim is to analyze the acquisition pipeline, resolving all the issues related to the size of the object, and the conditions of acquisition. We will discuss issues regarding acquisition planning and data gathering. We also present a new tool to interactively browse high resolution PTMs. Moreover, we perform some quality assessment considerations, in order to study the degradation of quality of the PTMs respect to the number and position of lights used to acquire the PTM. The results of our acquisition system are presented with some examples of PTMs of large artifacts like a sarcophagus of 2.4 $\\times$ 1 m size. PTM can be a good alternative to 3D scanning for capturing and representing certain class of objects, like bas-relieves, having lower costs in terms of acquisition equipment and data processing time.","tags":null,"title":"High Quality PTM Acquisition: Reflection Transformation Imaging for Large Objects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcello Balzani","Claudio Montani","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"cf4a92308cb50d7e115859af24f26945","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2006/BMSP06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2006/BMSP06/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Il rilievo laser scanner terrestre come integrazione dei sistemi informativi di documentazione storica e di restauro","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guido Ranzuglia","Paolo Cignoni","Fabio Ganovelli","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"54ff1b37830b18c4c9a4e3e66f7408dd","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2006/RCGS06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2006/RCGS06/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Implementing Mesh-Based Approaches for deformable Objects on GPU","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcello Balzani","Federico Uccelli","Roberto Scopigno","Claudio Montani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"68f5d3aa0b788a3ae6128a9472a79459","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2006/BUSM06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2006/BUSM06/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"La Cattedrale di Pisa nella Piazza dei Miracoli: un rilievo 3D per l’integrazione con i sistemi informativi di documentazione storica e di restauro","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcello Balzani","Federico Uccelli","Roberto Scopigno","Claudio Montani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"480dd9d32d27f04bf9f9e48763e1d6fb","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2006/BUSM06a/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2006/BUSM06a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"La Cattedrale di Pisa: Un rilievo 3D per l'integrazione con i sistemi informativi di documentazione storica e di restauro","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrea Spinelli","Fabio Ganovelli","Claudio Montani","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"8a3bbafb31f765e89a029ab1f6af8c3a","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2006/SGMS06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2006/SGMS06/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Recovering 3D Architectural Information from Dense Digital Models of Buildings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Massimiliano Corsini","Matteo Dellepiane","Marco Callieri","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"7e5270ab12497f93e7375128145ff6ce","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2006/CDCS06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2006/CDCS06/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Reflection Transformation Imaging on Larger Objects: an Alternative Method for Virtual Representation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giuseppe Turini","Fabio Ganovelli","Claudio Montani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"72610e821affbdae39755a4f385b1ba0","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2006/TGM06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2006/TGM06/","section":"publication","summary":"Bone drilling is a fundamental task in several surgical procedures, including mastoidectomy, cochlear implantation, orbital surgery. It consists in eroding the part of the bone in contact with the tip of the surgical tool when a sufficient pressure is exerted. Since the bone is an almost rigid material, the bone drilling simulations usually employ voxel-based representations of the bone, so that it is easy to show material removal by playing with material density in the voxels. Unfortunately, there are cases in which drilling is only a part of the task, and parts of the same object are also cut away or, worse, the bone is slightly deformable and therefore voxel-based representations do not work well. We propose a novel method to simulate drilling on objects represented explicitly by means of a tetrahedral mesh. The key idea of our method is to create an alternative representation of the tetrahedron when it is partially eroded. Such representation consists of a set of smaller tetrahedra obtained by a hierarchical decomposition of the original one, and combined to represent the current status of the erosion.","tags":null,"title":"Simulating Drilling on Tetrahedral Meshes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gerhard Wolf","Roberto Sigismondi","Roberto Scopigno","Matteo Scognamiglio","Claudio

map registration is still the most time consuming phase in the processing of 3D scanning data. This is because real scanning sets are composed of hundreds of range maps and their registration is still partially manual. We propose a nehttps://vcgdata.isti.cnr.itplex scan sets acquired by following a regular scanner pose pattern. Our goal is to defihttps://vcgdata.isti.cnr.ity graph by coarsely aligning couples of range maps that we know are partially overlapping thahttps://vcgdata.isti.cnr.itnning strategy. For a pair of partially overlapping range maps, our iterative solution locates pairs of correspondent vertices through the computation of a regular n×n kernel which takes into account vertex normals and is defined in the 2D space of the range map (represented in implicit 2D format rather than as a triangle mesh in 3D space). The shape-characterization kernel and the metrics defined give a sufficiently accurate shape matching, which has been proven to fit well the requirements of automatic registration. This initial set of adjacency arcs can then be augmented by the automatic identification of the other significant arcs, by adopting a criterion based on approximate range map overlap computation. With respect to the solutions present in literature, the simplifications and assumptions adopted make our solution specifically oriented to complex 3D scanning campaigns (hundreds of range maps). The proposed method can coarsely register range maps in parallel with the acquisition activity and this is a valuable help in assessing on site the completeness of the sampling of large objects.","tags":null,"title":"Exploiting the scanning sequence for automatic registration of large sets of range maps","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rita Borgo","Matteo Dellepiane","Paolo Cignoni","Laura Papaleo","Michela Spagnuolo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"8ef1f904978c16771686fe9906f39aa7","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2005/BDCPS05/","publishdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2005/BDCPS05/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Extracting Meta-Information From 3-Dimensional Shapes With Protégé","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Riccardo Scateni","Paolo Cignoni","Claudio Montani","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"50944d678a08aade9a7d6a231081b4d3","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2005/SCMS05/","publishdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2005/SCMS05/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Fondamenti di Grafica Tridimensionale Interattiva","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paolo Cignoni","Claudio Rocchini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"9d25323900c57b78ce11ffd70b088b1b","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2005/CR05a/","publishdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2005/CR05a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Generating random points in a tetrahedron","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"49331637c04320bb1592816d636ba1cc","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2005/Sco05/","publishdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2005/Sco05/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Gestione Efficiente dei Dati Prodotti dai Sistemi di Scansione Tridimensionale","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Clara Baracchini","Andrea Brogi","Marco Callieri","Lucia Capitani","Paolo Cignoni","Andrea Fasano","Claudio Montani","C.

Each technique has advantages but also drawbacks like noise sensitivity (isosurface extraction), risk of leakages (level sets), oversmoothing and impossible handling of topological changes (Deformable models). To obtain a good trade-off between robustness, shape constraints and topological control, we propose a 3D balloon/isosurface method joining the advantages in curvature control, leakage penalization and efficiency of parametric surfaces with a fast re-parametrization handling topological changes. It is based on the control of surface self-intersections, freezing of the intersected nodes and replacement of the final mesh with an isosurface computed on a field representing the signed distance from the true surface.","tags":null,"title":"Robust segmentation of anatomical structures with deformable surfaces and marching cubes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael S.
