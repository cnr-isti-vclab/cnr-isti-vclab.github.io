This paper introduces a method for generating sets of tileable and exchangeable flat patterns as well as a model-reduction strategy that enables their mechanical simulation at interactive rates. This method is included in a design pipeline that aims to turn any general flat surface into a pattern tessellation, which is able to deform under a given loading scenario.

In the context of bending-active structures, such a concept can be used to control the flexibility of the panels forming a surface without changing the constituting material. These panels undergo a formation process of deformation by bending, and application of internal restraints. This paper describes a new constructional system, FlexMaps, that has initiated the adoption of bending-active mesostructures at the architectural scale. Here, these modules are in the form of four-arms spirals made of CNC-milled plywood and are designed to reach the desired target shape once assembled. All phases from the conceptual design to the fabrication are seamlessly linked within an automated workflow. To illustrate the potential of the system, the paper discusses the results of a demonstrator project entitled FlexMaps Pavilion (3.90x3.96x3.25 meters) that has been exhibited at the IASS Symposium in 2019 and more recently at the 2021 17th International Architecture Exhibition, La Biennale di Venezia. The structural response is investigated through a detailed structural analysis, and the long-term behavior is assessed through a photogrammetric survey.

The diagrid is the widespread type of tube system and consists of a diagonal grid of beams that wraps the building, forming a diamond pattern. It performs as lateral bracing and is additionally able to sustain vertical loading through axial forces. Despite its efficiency, a growing interest is recently observed in alternative geometries to replace the diagrid pattern and improve the architectural impact conferred by the building skin aesthetics on the urban environment. The paper pursues the use of a Voronoi mesh, in which the geometry of the cells is steered to known schemes for the structural design of a cantilever tube structure. The objective is to mimic a macroscopic structural behavior through a topology and size modification of the Voronoi mesh that increases the density for creating resisting paths with higher stiffness. The paper proposes a novel method Vorogrid for designing a new class of tall buildings equipped with an organic-looking and mechanically-sound tube structure, which makes them a valuable alternative to competitors (diagrid, hexagrid, random Voronoi). Diagrids and hexagrids still remain more efficient in terms of forces and displacements but are characterized by a more usual appearance, instead Vorogrid offers more design control and better performances on average with respect to random Voronoi structures. This method is streamed into a pipeline that includes grid initialization strategies, geometric and structural optimization to mitigate the effects of the grid randomness, and structural sizing.","tags":null,"title":"Vorogrid: A static-aware variable-density Voronoi mesh to design the tube structure tessellation of tall buildings","type":"Publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Eurographics conferred to VC Lab Head Paolo Cignoni the 2021 Outstanding Technical Contributions Award for his extraordinary technical contribution to 3D graphics!\n","date":1618963200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618963200,"objectID":"deaef6e335076fa513ab29d79c122fd5","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/post/21-04-21-paolo-cignoni-award/","publishdate":"2021-04-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/21-04-21-paolo-cignoni-award/","section":"post","summary":"Eurographics conferred to VC Lab Head Paolo Cignoni the 2021 Outstanding Technical Contributions Award for his extraordinary technical contribution to 3D graphics!","tags":null,"title":"Paolo Cignoni: Outstanding Technical Contributions Award","type":"post"},{"authors":["Fauzia Albertin","Chiara Ruberto","Costanza Cucci","Marco Callieri","Marco Potenziani","Eliana Siotto","Paolo Pingi","Roberto Scopigno","Matteo Bettuzzi","Rosa Brancaccio","Maria Pia Morigi","Lisa Castelli","Francesco Taccetti","Marcello Picollo","Lorenzo Stefani","Francesca De Vita"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"319d6cd3ef330dba5615f95c67a8c08c","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2021/ARCCPSPSBBMCTPSD21/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2021/ARCCPSPSBBMCTPSD21/","section":"Publication","summary":"Scientific investigations of artworks are crucial in terms of preservation since they provide a measurable evaluation of the materials and the state of conservation. This is the case of Antonello da Messina's painting \"Ecce Homo\": its delicate state of conservation, with the need for constant monitoring, required a broad and in-depth diagnostic campaign to support the restorers. The project was carried out entirely in situ using non-invasive cutting-edge techniques and proposes a multimodal and data-centric approach, integrating 3D and 2D methodologies. The surface irregularities and the support were analysed with a structured-light 3D scanner and X-ray tomography. The painting materials were investigated with X-ray fluorescence scanning (MA-XRF) and reflectance hyperspectral imaging (HSI). Primarily, the data were jointly used for a scientific scope and provided new knowledge of the painting in terms of materials and painting techniques. In addition, two web-based interactive platforms were developed: one to provide restorers and experts with a new perspective of the hidden geometries of the painting, and the other targeted at the general public for dissemination purposes. The results of the Ecce Homo scientific analysis were exhibited, using a touch-screen interface, and developed for different user levels, from adults to kids.","tags":null,"title":"“Ecce Homo” by Antonello da Messina, from non-invasive investigations to data fusion and dissemination","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Daniele Fornari","Luigi Malomo","Paolo Cignoni"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"426f98fcb29bbf5f0e47f48a47e513e6","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2021/FMC21/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2021/FMC21/","section":"Publication","summary":"The interaction between a 2D input device (like a mouse or a touchscreen) and a 3D object on the screen with the purpose of examining it in detail is a well-studied interaction problem.

Although, over the years, studies led to a wide variety of solutions to overcome this problem, most of them are not actually available in real-world applications. In particular, for 3D web applications, only basic solutions are often implemented, and even the most used web framework for 3D still lacks state of the art implementations.

A critical issue for these technologies is finding paradigms that allow user interactions in ways that are as similar as possible to the real world, bringing physicality into the experience. Current literature has shown, with different experiments, that the mapping of real objects in virtual reality alongside haptic feedback significantly increases the realism of the experience and user engagement, leading to augmented virtuality. In this paper, we present a system to improve engagement in a VR experience using inexpensive, physical, and sensorized copies of real artefacts made with cheap 3D fabrication technologies. Based on a combination of hardware and software components, the proposed system gives the user the possibility to interact with the physical replica in the virtual environment and to see the appearance of the original cultural heritage artefact. In this way, we overcome one of the main limitations of mainstream 3D fabrication technologies: a faithful appearance reproduction. Using a consumer device for the real-time hand tracking and a custom electronic controller for the capacitive touch sensing, the system permits the creation of augmented experiences where the user with their hands can change the virtual appearance of the real replica object using a set of personalization actions selectable from a physical 3D-printed palette.","tags":null,"title":"Augmented Virtuality Using Touch-Sensitive 3D-Printed Objects","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Stefano Nuvoli","Alessandro Tola","Alessandro Muntoni","Nico Pietroni","Enrico Gobbetti","Riccardo Scateni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"856bf0bbd89726c6fcddd7194a461298","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2021/NTMPGS21/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2021/NTMPGS21/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Automatic surface segmentation for seamless fabrication using 4-axis milling machines","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Gaia Pavoni","Massimiliano Corsini","Nicole Pedersen","Vid Petrovic","Paolo Cignoni"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"c137fa2f8eb1d0a9169939f030a64add","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2021/PCPPC21/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2021/PCPPC21/","section":"Publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Challenges in the deep learning-based semantic segmentation of benthic communities from Ortho-images","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Alderighi","Daniela Giorgi","Luigi Malomo","Paolo Cignoni","Monica Zoppè"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"36bbbd9dfa45f90f1a41c11c9bdc7d3a","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2021/AGMCZ21/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2021/AGMCZ21/","section":"Publication","summary":"Tangible 3D molecular models conceptualize complex phenomena in a stimulating and engaging format. This is especially true for learning environments, where additive manufacturing is increasingly used to produce teaching aids for chemical education. However, the 3D models presented previously are limited in the type of molecules they can represent and the amount of information they carry. In addition, they have little role in representing complex biological entities such as proteins. We present the first complete workflow for the fabrication of soft models of complex proteins of any size. We leverage on molding technologies to generate accurate, soft models which incorporate both spatial and functional aspects of large molecules. Our method covers the whole pipeline from molecular surface preparation and editing to actual 3D model fabrication. The models fabricated with our strategy can be used as aids to illustrate biological functional behavior, such as assembly in quaternary structure and docking mechanisms, which are difficult to convey with traditional visualization methods.

Since many resources are attributed to these buildings, their design should consider a proper performance-based construction economy and environmental sustainable development. This research introduces a new concept for a bundled tall building founded on the use of a multi-core-outrigger system, which is additionally enriched with diagrid structures. The concept is inspired by the bamboo plant and follows the biomimetic design principles for the structural organization and performance-based criteria for optimizing the lateral stiffness and for shaping the cross section. Particularly, the incident wind speed is maximized to exploit Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs), which are located along the whole building height at the center of the bundled towers. The building morphogenesis is accomplished by a multistep methodology that is fully developed in a parametric environment and includes structural and computational fluid dynamic analyses. With the aim of validating the proposed concept, a case study of a 320-m-tall three-core building has been designed for the city of Pisa, Italy. The use of VAWTs results in an annual emissions reduction of about 10 kgCO_2/m^2.   https://doi.org/10.1002/tal.1839","tags":null,"title":"Morphogenesis of a bundled tall building: Biomimetic, structural, and wind-energy design of a multi-core-outrigger system combined with diagrid","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Federico Landi","Marcella Cornia","Lorenzo Baraldi","Massimiliano Corsini","Rita Cucchiara"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"20c880157e5089f6d0046614fcf0241c","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2021/LCBCC21/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2021/LCBCC21/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Multimodal attention networks for low-level vision-and-language navigation","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Nico Pietroni","Stefano Nuvoli","Thomas Alderighi","Paolo Cignoni","Marco Tarini"],"categories":null,"content":" 10.1145/3450626.3459941\nwww.quadmesh.cloud\nDownload the slides!

We define a perfectly feature-aligned cross-field and a coarse layout of polygonal-shaped patches where we strictly ensure that all the feature-lines are represented as patch boundaries. To be able to consistently do so, we allow non-quadrilateral patches and T-junctions in the layout; the key is the ability to constrain the layout so that it still admits a globally consistent, T-junction-free, and pure-quad internal tessellation of its patches. This requires the insertion of additional irregular-vertices inside patches, but the regularity of the final-mesh is safeguarded by optimizing for both their number and for their reciprocal alignment. In total, our method guarantees the reproduction of feature-lines by construction, while still producing good quality, isometric, pure-quad, conforming meshes, making it an ideal candidate for CAD models. Moreover, the method is fully automatic, requiring no user intervention, and remarkably reliable, requiring little assumptions on the input mesh, as we demonstrate by batch processing the entire Thingi10K repository, with less than 0.5% of the attempted cases failing to produce a usable mesh..

This class of 3D data is becoming increasingly important thanks to the growing popularity of reliable, ready-to-use photogrammetry software packages. The resulting textured models are richly detailed, but their underlying parametrization typically falls short of many practical requirements, particularly exhibiting excessive fragmentation and consequent problems. Producing a completely new UV-map, with standard parametrization techniques, and then resampling a new texture image, is often neither practical nor desirable for at least two reasons: first, these models have characteristics (such as inconsistencies, high resolution) that make them unfit for automatic or manual parametrization; second, the required resampling leads to unnecessary signal degradation because this process is unaware of the original texel densities. In contrast, our method improves the existing UV-map instead of replacing it, balancing the reduction of the map fragmentation with signal degradation due to resampling, while also avoiding oversampling of the original signal. The proposed approach is fully automatic and extensively tested on a large benchmark of photo-reconstructed models; quantitative evaluation evidences a drastic and consistent improvement of the mappings.   https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.142615    Reference implementation available at https://github.com/maggio-a/texture-defrag","tags":null,"title":"Texture Defragmentation for Photo-Reconstructed 3D Models","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Scopigno","Federico Ponchio","Matteo Dellepiane","Marco Callieri","Francesco Banterle","Marco Potenziani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"0dc1def7e681aa52c075b23418aab45b","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2021/PBCDPS21/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2021/PBCDPS21/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Virtual clones for cultural heritage applications","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Alderighi","Luigi Malomo","Bernd Bickel","Paolo Cignoni","Nico Pietroni"],"categories":null,"content":" Presentation slides (.pptx)\n","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"fcac7c0528bb395ee10e78686c2f3127","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2021/AMBCP21/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2021/AMBCP21/","section":"Publication","summary":"We introduce a novel technique to automatically decompose an input object's volume into a set of parts that can be represented by two opposite height fields. Such decomposition enables the manufacturing of individual parts using two-piece reusable rigid molds.

The desired deformation of the panels derives from the proper selection of their elastic properties. Optimized panels, called FlexMaps, are designed such that, once they are bent and assembled, the resulting static equilibrium configuration matches a desired input 3D shape. The FlexMaps elastic properties are controlled by locally varying spiraling geometric mesostructures, which are optimized in size and shape to match specific bending requests, namely the global curvature of the target shape. The design pipeline starts from a quad mesh representing the input 3D shape, which defines the edge size and the total amount of spirals: every quad will embed one spiral. Then, an optimization algorithm tunes the geometry of the spirals by using a simplified pre-computed rod model. This rod model is derived from a non-linear regression algorithm which approximates the non-linear behavior of solid FEM spiral models subject to hundreds of load combinations. This innovative pipeline has been applied to the project of a lightweight plywood pavilion named FlexMaps Pavilion, which is a single-layer piecewise twisted arch that fits a bounding box of 3.90x3.96x3.25 meters. This case study serves to test the applicability of this methodology at the architectural scale. The structure is validated via FE analyses and the fabrication of the full scale prototype.

This results in vectorial thematic maps segmented according to their construction technique (isolating areas of homogeneous materials/structure/texture) or state of conservation, including degradation areas and damaged parts. This time-consuming manual work, often done with tools that have not been designed for this purpose, represents a bottleneck in the documentation and management workflow and is a severely limiting factor in monitoring large-scale monuments (e.g.city walls).

However, they pose two significant challenges. The first one is to assure adequate safety and redundancy concerning possible global collapse. Being single-layered, in a shell made of structural glass, the brittle cracking of a single pane can lead to a sudden propagation of failure, up to instability. The second one is to guarantee cheap replacing possibilities for potentially collapsed components. This research explores a novel concept to address both requirements, where glass is both post-tensioned and reinforced and develops the research on TVT post-tensioned glass beams. Following the Fail- Safe Design (FSD) principles, a steel reinforcement relieves glass deficiencies (i.e. brittleness and low tensile strength). Following the Damage Avoidance Design (DAD) principles, glass segmentation and post-tensioning avoid the propagation of cracks. Up to now, glass-steel systems were limited to mono-dimensional elements (such as beams and columns) or simple bi-dimensional elements (arches, domes, barrel vaults). Instead, massive structures are usually realized as grid shells, where glass is used as simple cladding. This research investigates piecewise triangulated glass shells to enable the creation of 3D free-form glass-steel systems, where glass is load-bearing material. Hence, laminated glass panels are mechanically coupled with a filigree steel truss, whose elements are placed at the edges of the panel and act as an unbonded reinforcement. In a performance-based perspective, these steel trusses can be sized to bear at least the weight of all panels in the occurrence of simultaneous cracks (worst-case scenario). The panels are post-tensioned using a set of edge-aligned cables that add beneficial compressive stress on glass to prevent crack initiation. The cable placement and accompanying pre-loads are derived with an optimization strategy that minimizes the tensile stress acting on the shell. This optimization procedure also considers the practical constraints involved in the process. The results obtained through this automated procedure are later investigated using nonlinear FE analyses. The resulting structures optimize the total material usage providing contemporarily both transparency and load-bearing capabilities. Posttensioned shells excel in static performances, achieving high stiffness and good redundancy for the worst-case scenario, and improve the structural lightness and the visual impact with respect to state-of-the-art competitors.","tags":null,"title":"Automated Design and Analysis of Reinforced and Post-Tensioned Glass Shells","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Giovanni Pintore","Claudio Mura","Fabio Ganovelli","Lizeth Fuentes-Perez","Renato Pajarola","Enrico Gobbetti"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"4cd438af3c79821bfd64d0e7cf572527","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2020/PMGFPG20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2020/PMGFPG20/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Automatic 3D Reconstruction of Structured Indoor Environments","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Maurizio Froli","Francesco Laccone"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"98d863b0972b6d47a02162b07d743c1d","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2020/FL20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2020/FL20/","section":"Publication","summary":"The paper introduces a novel concept for structural glass shells that is based on the mechanical coupling of double curved heat-bent glass panels and a wire frame mesh, which constitutes a grid of unbonded edge-reinforcement.

The main novelty lies in the use of polygonal curved panelswith a nodal force transfer mechanism. This concept has been validated on an illustrative design case of a 6 m-diameter suspended glass sphere, in which regular pentagonal and hexagonal spherical panels are employed. The good strength and stiffness achieved for this structure is demonstrated by means of local and global FE models. Another fundamental feature of the concept is that the reinforcement grid provides residual strength in the extreme scenarios in which all panels are completely failed.

Digital 3D models of this class come with a unique set of characteristics and defects - especially concerning their parametrization - setting them starkly apart from 3D models originating from other, more traditional, sources. We study this class of 3D models by collecting a significant number of representatives and quantitatively evaluating their quality according to several metrics. These include a new invariant metric we carefully design to assess the amount of fragmentation of the UV map, which is one of the main weaknesses potentially hindering the usability of these models. Our results back the widely shared notion that models of this new class are still not fit for direct use in downstream applications (such as videogames), and require challenging processing steps. Regrettably, existing automatic geometry processing tools are not always up to the task: for example, we verify that the available tools for UV optimization often fail due to mesh inconsistencies, geometric and topological noise, excessive resolution, or other factors; moreover, even when an output is produced, it rarely represents a significant improvement over the input (according to the aforementioned measures). Therefore, we argue that further advancements are required by the computer graphics and geometry processing communities specifically targeted at this class of models. Towards this goal, we share the models we collected in this study as a new public repository, Real-World Textured Things (RWTT), intended as a benchmark to systematic field-test and compare future algorithms. RWTT  consists of 568 carefully selected textured 3D models representative of the most popular photo-reconstruction tools currently available.

Inspired by classical Michell trusses, we create a reinforcement layout whose members are aligned with optimal stress directions, then optimize their shape minimizing the volume while keeping stresses bounded. We exploit two predominant techniques for reinforcing shells: adding ribs aligned with stress directions and using thicker walls on regions of high stress. Most previous work can generate either only ribs or only variablethickness walls. However, in the general case, neither approach by itself will provide optimal solutions. By using a more precise volume model, our method is capable of producing optimized structures with the full range of qualitative behaviors: from ribs to walls, and smoothly transitioning in between. Our method includes new algorithms for determining the layout of reinforcement structure elements, and an efficient algorithm to optimize their shape, minimizing a non-linear non-convex functional at a fraction of the cost and with better optimality compared to standard solvers. We demonstrate the optimization results for a variety of shapes, and the improvements it yields in the strength of 3D-printed objects.","tags":null,"title":"Reinforcement of General Shell Structures","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Mario  Salinas","Daniela Giorgi","Federico Ponchio","Paolo Cignoni"],"categories":null,"content":" Reviewernet.org\n","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"be0ec7ec56c73f388cdb0cf095c11ffc","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2020/SGPC20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2020/SGPC20/","section":"Publication","summary":"We propose ReviewerNet, an online, interactive visualization system aimed to improve the reviewer selection process in the academic domain.

In the subsequent decades, topology would have a great influence on the way in which artists and architects sensed and represented space. Among them, the Italian architect Vittorio Giorgini (1926 - 2010) pioneered the topology-flavoured ideas of elastic surfaces and of form as a dynamic structure. Beside his architectural works, Giorgini left a few enchanting sculptures, in which he explored the connection between shape and topology. In this paper, we first present Giorgini's beautiful architectural designs, which were largely unrecognized in his lifetime, and they have only recently started to receive the attention they deserved. Then, we explain the topological ideas behind six of his sculptures, in a formal mathematical language. Surprisingly enough for non-mathematicians, four of his most famous sculptures - Modified Klein, Giorgini Sphere, Giorgini Torus I, and Giorgini Torus III - turn out to be topologically equivalent. This means that they can be continuously deformed into one another, even though their geometric appearances are very different from each other. We first illustrate by drawing the steps in the deformation process. Then, we provide a formal proof of the equivalence using basic notions from algebraic topology: non-orientable genus, Euler characteristic, and the classification theorem for surfaces. Giorgini designed his three-dimensional figures in-between the late 1960's and the first half of the 2000's. The figures only existed as bi-dimensional drawings for many years. Then, Giorgini asked David Dainelli and Alessandro Marzetti to carve alabaster sculptures from his drawings, in their artistic workshop in Volterra (Pisa, Italy), under his direct supervision. Giorgini's sculptures represent non-orientable surfaces. Intuitively, non-orientable surfaces are one-sided: one could paint in colour the whole surface without crossing its boundary and without detaching the brush. That would not be possible for orientable surfaces such as the familiar cylinder and sphere, which are two-sided. The first sculpture we present is Modified Klein, a Klein bottle with a disk removed. The Klein bottle is a well-known and fascinating example of a non-orientable surface, which not only is one-sided, but also closed (it has no boundaries) while it does not enclose an interior. As it often happens with physical reproductions of the Klein bottle, Giorgini cut a disk around the surface self-intersection. The other three sculptures named Giorgini Sphere, Giorgini Torus I, and Giorgini Torus III are constructed through variations on the same procedure: start from a sphere (a torus), cut away portions of the surface to make a cylinder, then connect the top and bottom boundaries of the cylinder with a strip without twisting, to get a non-orientable surface. What would sound surprising to a non-topologist is that, beside being neither spheres nor toruses, the three sculptures are topologically equivalent to Modified Klein. All four sculptures are non-orientable surfaces with one boundary, and after some calculations one can verify they all have non-orientable genus equal to 2: being the non-orientable genus a topological invariant, the four sculptures share the same topological type. In our paper, for illustration purposes, we draw eight steps in the deformation process which takes Modified Klein to Giorgini Torus I. Finally, we report on the topological type of two other sculptures: Giorgini Torus II, a non-orientable surface with three boundaries which has the topology of a Moebius strip minus two disks, and Giorgini Torus IV, a non-orientable surface with two boundaries which has the topology of a sphere with five holes, three of which are capped by Moebius strips.\nBridges 2020 presentation (.pptx)\nDeforming Modified Kein into Giorgini Torus I (.mp4)\n\n\n\nVittorio Giorgini: Architetture d'Alabastro, by Duccio Benvenuti","tags":null,"title":"Topological Classification of Vittorio Giorgini’s Sculptures","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Rachele Manganelli del Fà","Giovanni Pancani","Giovanni Minutoli","Andrea Arrighetti","Gabriella Poggesi","Marco Callieri"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"87f6795e809f5c564d3feef7f71e0f43","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2020/PAMPMC20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2020/PAMPMC20/","section":"Publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Tumulo etrusco della Montagnola: un viaggio virtuale","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Nicola Capece","Francesco Banterle","Paolo Cignoni","Fabio Ganovelli","Ugo Erra"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"87fe44e213add9c6950c82c74438b192","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2020/CBCGE20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2020/CBCGE20/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Turning a Smartphone Selfie Into a Studio Portrait ","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Maurizio Froli","Francesco Laccone","Agnese Natali"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"7b18dd96b15204820d6c26bdeebc6d46","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2020/FLN20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2020/FLN20/","section":"Publication","summary":"Transparency and structural lightness are inspiring ideas in the design of footbridges. Glass is the most performing transparent material to be used for structural purposes because of its high compressive strength, chemical stability, and absence of fatigue and viscosity phenomena at room temperature. However, its fragility constitutes a challenging limit in structural applications. This research provides and discusses a specific concept named TVT´ (Travi Vitree Tensegrity) for lightweight long-span beam-like footbridges made of structural glass. Hence, two design approaches of fail-safe design (FSD) and damage avoidance design (DAD) are applied to guarantee adequate safety levels and postcracking serviceability, respectively, with low damages on the main components. FSD provides the adoption of structural collaboration between glass and steel. Following DAD, glass is segmented into triangular panels, and reciprocal diffuse prestress is performed by steel tendons. This strategy assures low rehabilitation costs because only collapsed elements should be replaced once failed. At ultimate limit state (ULS), the TVTÎ´ footbridge attains a global ductile behavior in which the yielding of steel tendons occurs before any fragile failure. Such result is achieved through a hierarchic calibration of the chain of failures. In glass panels, which are mostly precompressed, the buckling failure, representing the main risk, is delayed by the mutual stabilization of the panels' compressed edges with steel clamping. However, because an accidental event may cause a localized or diffuse brittle failure of glass components, the system is designed to maintain a residual load bearing capacity in this scenario. At the serviceability limit state (SLS), the TVTÎ´ footbridge is highly stiffened by the presence of glass panes, partially encased in metallic frames. Crack initiation is delayed by precompression.","tags":null,"title":"TVT\u0026#948; Concept for Long-Span Glass–Steel Footbridges","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Mattia Angelini","Vito Ferrulli","Francesco Banterle","Massimiliano Corsini","Maria Antonietta Pascali","Paolo Cignoni","Daniela Giorgi"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"1b5c37d9c6e8684feecc2bdd7ff6b4bb","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2020/AFBCPCG20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2020/AFBCPCG20/","section":"Publication","summary":"We present the ongoing effort to build the first benchmark dataset for aestethic prediction on 3D models. The dataset is built on top of Sketchfab,  a popular platform for 3D content sharing. In our dataset, the visual 3D content is aligned with aesthetics-related metadata: each 3D model is associated with a number  of snapshots taken from different camera positions, the number of times the model has been viewed in-between its upload and its retrieval, the number of likes the model got,  and the tags and comments received from users. The metadata provide precious supervisory information for data-driven research on 3D visual attractiveness and preference prediction.  The paper contribution is twofold. First, we introduce an interactive platform for visualizing data about Sketchfab. We report a detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis  of numerical scores (views and likes collected by 3D models) and textual information (tags and comments) for different 3D object categories.  The analysis of the content of Sketchfab provided us the base for selecting a reasoned subset of annotated models. The second contribution is  the first version of the ViDA 3D dataset, which contains the full set of content required for data-driven approaches to 3D aesthetic analysis.  While similar datasets are available for images, to our knowledge this is the first attempt to create a benchmark for aestethic prediction for 3D models.

Complex morphologies are difficult to detect both from the networks, that may suffer from generalization issues, and from human operators, affecting the consistency of training datasets. The task of manual annotating biological structures is not comparable to a generic task of detecting an object (a car, a cat, or a flower) within an image. Biological structures are more similar to textures, and specimen borders exhibit intricate shapes. In this specific context, manual labelling is very sensitive to human error. The interactive validation of the predictions is a valuable resource to improve the network performance and address the inaccuracy caused by the lack of annotation consistency of human operators reported in literature. The proposed tool, inspired by the Yes/No Answer paradigm, integrates the semantic segmentation results coming from a CNN with the previous human labeling, allowing a more accurate annotation of thousands of instances in a short time.

Due to its brittle nature, glass can fail when it is subject to tensile forces. Hence, we enrich the structure with a cable net, which is specifically designed to post-tension the shell, relieving the underlying glass structure from tension. We automatically derive an optimized cable layout, together with the appropriate pre-load of each cable. The method is driven by a physically-based static analysis of the shell subject to its service load. We assess our approach by applying non-linear FEM analysis to several real scale application scenarios. Such a method of cable tensioning produces glass shells that are optimized from the material usage viewpoint since they exploit the high compression strength of glass. As a result, they are lightweight and robust. Both aesthetic and static qualities are improved with respect to grid shell competitors.

Unfortunately, the current solutions used to analyze multiple 3D scans acquired over time are based on very controlled acquisition procedures, such as the use of target reference points that are stationary over time and fixed to the artwork, or on complex hardware setups to keep the acquisition device fixed to the artwork. These procedures are challenging when a long monitoring period is involved or during restoration when the painting may be moved several times. This paper presents a new and robust approach to observe and quantify the panel deformations of artworks by comparing 3D models acquired with different scanning devices at different times. The procedure is based on a non-rigid registration algorithm that deforms one 3D model over the other in a controlled way, extracting the real deformation field. We apply the method to the 3D scanning data of the unfinished panel painting ``Adorazione dei Magi'' by Leonardo da Vinci. The data were acquired in 2002 and 2015. First, we analyze the two 3D models with the classical distance from the ideal flat plane of the painting. Then we study the type of deformation of each plank of the support by fitting a quadric surface. Finally, we compare the models before and after the deformation computed by a non-rigid registration algorithm. This last comparison enables the panel deformation to be separated from the structural changes (e.g. the structural restorations on the back and the missing pieces) of the artwork in a more robust way.","tags":null,"title":"Deformation analysis of Leonardo da Vinci\u0026apos;s \u0026ldquo;Adorazione dei Magi\u0026rdquo; through temporal unrelated 3D digitization","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Massimo Zallocco","Holly Wright","Lior Wolf","Lorenc Vila","Roberto Scopigno","Julian Richards","Michael Remmy","Eva Miguel Gascon","Marisol Madrid I Fernandez","Barak  Itkin","Miguel Angel Hervas","Maria Letizia  Gualandi","Gabriele Gattiglia","Tim Evans","Diego Lucendo Diaz","Nachum Dershowitz","Marco Callieri","Jaume Buxeda i Garrigos","Francesco Banterle","Francesca Anichini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"3d24eee382d83d05135361e26c2c4bc8","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2019/ABBCDDEGGHIMMRRSVWWZ/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2019/ABBCDDEGGHIMMRRSVWWZ/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Developing the ArchAIDE application: A digital workflow for identifying, organising and sharing archaeological pottery using automated image recognition","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Maurizio Froli","Linda Giresini","Francesco Laccone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"9cdbba1ef8b85a018bbaeeaea359b761","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2019/FGL19a/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2019/FGL19a/","section":"Publication","summary":"In the field of seismic risk mitigation of art objects, an innovative isolation device is here il-lustrated.

DIQM can emulate existing visual metrics efficiently, reducing the computational costs by more than an order of magnitude with respect to existing implementations.\n\n\nTimings Our method is extremely computationally efficient because the transfer of knowledge from HDR-VDP to a CNN allows us to speed-up computations by performing only simple convolutions. When we compare our method (DIQM) to classic HDR-VDP (MATLAB implementation and its CUDA version), we can measure 1-2 orders of magnitude of speed-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications Our method can be employed to optimize the parameters for HDR compression, tone mapping, and inverse tone mapping. This can be achieved with classic metrics such as HDR-VDP and DRIIM. However, these metrics are computationally expensive and a lot of time (e.g., minutes) would be required to optimize the parameters of a low-resolution image. Our method can manage these tasks in a few seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTone mapped HDR image without parameters optimization.

The desired deformation of the panels derives from the proper selection of their elastic properties. Optimized panels, called FlexMaps, are designed such that, once they are bent and assembled, the resulting static equilibrium configuration matches a desired input 3D shape. The FlexMaps elastic properties are controlled by locally varying spiraling geometric mesostructures, which are optimized in size and shape to match the global curvature (i.e., bending requests) of the target shape. The design pipeline starts from a quad mesh representing the input 3D shape, which determines the edge size and the total amount of spirals: every quad will embed one spiral. Then, an optimization algorithm tunes the geometry of the spirals by using a simplified pre-computed rod model. This rod model is derived from a non-linear regression algorithm which approximates the non-linear behavior of solid FEM spiral models subject to hundreds of load combinations.

Although rendering and processing such data has been extensively studied, little attention has been devoted using the light transport hidden in the recorded per-sample color response to relight virtual objects in visual effects (VFX) look-dev or augmented reality (AR) scenarios. Typically, standard relighting environment exploits global environment maps together with a collection of local light probes to reflect the light mood of the real scene on the virtual object. We propose instead a unified spatial approximation of the radiance and visibility relationships present in the scene, in the form of a colored point cloud. To do so, our method relies on two core components: High Dynamic Range (HDR) expansion and real-time Point-Based Global Illumination (PBGI). First, since an acquired color point cloud typically comes in Low Dynamic Range (LDR) format, we boost it using a single HDR photo exemplar of the captured scene that can cover part of it. We perform this expansion efficiently by first expanding the dynamic range of a set of renderings of the point cloud and then projecting these renderings on the original cloud. At this stage, we propagate the expansion to the regions not covered by the renderings or with low-quality dynamic range by solving a Poisson system. Then, at rendering time, we use the resulting HDR point cloud to relight virtual objects, providing a diffuse model of the indirect illumination propagated by the environment. To do so, we design a PBGI algorithm that exploits the GPU's geometry shader stage as well as a new mipmapping operator, tailored for G-buffers, to achieve real-time performances. As a result, our method can effectively relight virtual objects exhibiting diffuse and glossy physically-based materials in real time. Furthermore, it accounts for the spatial embedding of the object within the 3D environment. We evaluate our approach on manufactured scenes to assess the error introduced at every step from the perfect ground truth. We also report experiments with real captured data, covering a range of capture technologies, from active scanning to multiview stereo reconstruction. \t \t\t \t  Slides","tags":null,"title":"High Dynamic Range Point Clouds for Real-Time Relighting","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Ific Goudé","Rémi  Cozot","Francesco Banterle"],"categories":null,"content":"link\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"f2d832daea5999d6d96d3b469671ad24","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2019/GCB19/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2019/GCB19/","section":"Publication","summary":"Abstract  We propose a Tone Mapping Operator, denoted HMD-TMO, dedicated to the visualization of 360° High Dynamic Range images on Head Mounted Displays. The few existing studies about this topic have shown that the existing Tone Mapping Operators for classic 2D images are not adapted to 360° High Dynamic Range images. Consequently, several dedicated operators have been proposed. Instead of operating on the entire 360° image, they only consider the part of the image currently viewed by the user. Tone mapping a part of the 360° image is less challenging as it does not preserve the global luminance dynamic of the scene. To cope with this problem, we propose a novel tone mapping operator which takes advantage of both a view-dependant tone mapping that enhances the contrast, and a Tone Mapping Operator applied to the entire 360° image that preserves global coherency.

Milling the edges of each flat facet simplifies the manual assembly, which consists only in folding adjacent facets at a constrained angle. Our method generates simplified shapes where every dihedral angle between adjacent facets belongs to a restricted set, thus making the assembly process quicker and more straightforward. Firstly, our method automatically computes a simplified version of the input model, using the marching cubes algorithm on the original mesh and iteratively performing local changes on the resulting triangle mesh. The user can then perform an additional manual simplification to remove unwanted facets.

Long-term monitoring projects usually requires the collection of large quantities of data, and the visual analysis of a human expert operator remains, in this context, a very time consuming task.

Strategies for the automatic recognition of benthic communities are required to effectively exploit all the information contained in visual data.

In this work, we discuss the advantages offered by the use of annotated high resolution ortho-mosaics of seabed to classify and segment the investigated specimens, and we suggest several strategies to obtain a considerable per-pixel classification performance although the use of a reduced training dataset composed by a single ortho-mosaic.

For computational reasons and given the absence of fully calibrated imagery, rudimentary color reproduction is often added as a post-processing step rather than integrated into tone reproduction algorithms. In the general case, this currently requires manual parameter tuning, and can be automated only for some global tone reproduction operators by inferring parameters from the tone curve. We present a novel and fully automatic saturation correction technique, suitable for any tone reproduction operator (including inverse tone reproduction), which exhibits fewer distortions in hue and luminance reproduction than the current state-of-the-art. We validated its comparative effectiveness through subjective experiments and objective metrics. Our experiments confirm that saturation correction significantly contributes toward the perceptually plausible color reproduction of tonemapped content and would, therefore, be useful in any color-critical application.\nlink to the paper","tags":null,"title":"Automatic saturation correction for dynamic range management algorithms","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Marco Potenziani","Marco Callieri","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"dc5636698ea94fad87258460dd3bbc31","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2018/PCS18a/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2018/PCS18a/","section":"Publication","summary":"3DHOP (3D Heritage On-line Presenter) has been released 4 years ago, as an open-source framework for the creation of interactive visualization of 3D content on the web, aimed at the CH field.

The current techniques for the analysis of time-varying data can efficiently detect actual significant geometric changes and rule out differences due to irrelevant variations (like sampling, lighting, coverage). On the other hand, the effective visualization of such detected changes can be challenging when we want to show at the same time the original appearance of the 3D model. In this paper, we propose a dynamic technique for the effective visualization of detected differences between two 3D scenes. The presented approach, while retaining the original appearance, allows the user to switch between the two models in a way that enhances the geometric differences that have been detected as significant. Additionally, the same technique is able to visually hides the other negligible, yet visible, variations. The main idea is to use two distinct screen space time-based interpolation functions for the significant 3D differences and for the small variations to hide. We have validated the proposed approach in a user study on a different class of datasets, proving the objective and subjective effectiveness of the method.  \t\tInteractive Web Application","tags":null,"title":"Enhanced Visualization of Detected 3D Geometric Differences","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Filippo A.

Despite the increasing HDR popularity, very little attention has been devoted to new forensic problems that are characteristic to this content. In this paper, we address for the first time such kind of problem, by identifying the source of an HDR picture. Specifically, we consider the two currently most common techniques to generate an HDR image: by fusing multiple LDR images with different exposure time, or by inverse tone mapping an LDR picture. We show that, in order to apply conventional forensic tools to HDR images, they need to be properly preprocessed, and we propose and evaluate a few simple HDR forensic preprocessing strategies for this purpose. In addition, we propose a new forensic feature based on Fisher scores, calculated under Gaussian mixture models. We show that the proposed feature outperforms the popular SPAM features in classifying the HDR image source on image blocks as small as 3x3, which makes our method suitable to detect composite forgeries combining HDR patches originating from different acquisition processes.

The difficulty with image-based 3D reconstruction algorithms is that images of wires of the power lines typically do not have point features to match among different images. We leverage on a few assumptions that can be made on the power lines case and define an ad-hoc strategy for solving the problem.

Starting from a reference model to which we want to align a new 3D mesh, our method starts by decomposing it in patches using a Lloyd clustering before running an ICP local registration for each patch. Then, we improve the alignment using few geometric constraints and finally, we build a global deformation function that blends the estimated per-patch transformations. This function is structured on top of a deformation graph derived from the dual graph of the clustering. Our algorithm is iterated until convergence, increasing progressively the number of patches in the clustering to capture smaller deformations. The method comes with a scalable multicore implementation that enables, for the first time, the alignment of meshes made of tens of millions of triangles in a few minutes. We report extensive experiments of our algorithm on several dense Multi-View Stereo models, using a 3D scan or another MVS reconstruction as reference. Beyond MVS data, we also applied our algorithm to different scenarios, exhibiting more complex and larger deformations, such as 3D motion capture dataset or 3D scans of dynamic objects. The good alignment results obtained for both datasets highlights the efficiency and the flexibility of our approach.","tags":null,"title":"Scalable non-rigid registration for multi-view stereo data","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Daniela Pica","Gaia Pavoni","Ubaldo Pantaleo","Monica Rivas Casado","Marco Palma","Carlo Cerrano"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"72a9ce8bdd3bd99f61e17ad0cf1462f9","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2018/PRPPPC18/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2018/PRPPPC18/","section":"Publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"SfM-Based Method to Assess Gorgonian Forests (Paramuricea clavata (Cnidaria, Octocorallia))","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Alessandro Muntoni","Andreas Scalas","Stefano Nuvoli","Riccardo Scateni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"55654ed3c7503bea3bc3ffbac8999466","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2018/MSNS18/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2018/MSNS18/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Simplification of Shapes for Fabrication with V-Groove Milling Tools","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Patrick Seemann","Gianpaolo Palma","Matteo Dellepiane","Paolo Cignoni","Michael Goesele"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"767fa3a5efa8cdbe4dfd16f8716cba1f","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2018/SPDCG18/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2018/SPDCG18/","section":"Publication","summary":"We propose a novel rendering framework for visualizing point data with complex structures and/or different quality of data.

Our rendering method uses the scalar field to render points as solid splats or semi-transparent spheres with non-uniform density to produce the final image. To that end, we derive a base model for integrating density in (intersecting) spheres for both the uniform and non-uniform setting and introduce a simple and fast approximation which yields interactive rendering speeds for millions of points. Because our method only relies on the basic OpenGL rasterization pipeline, rendering properties can be adjusted in real-time by user.

Although current 3D printing pipelines still suffer from several restrictions, accuracy in reproduction has reached an excellent level. The manufacturing industry has been the main domain of 3D printing applications over the last decade. Digital fabrication techniques have also been demonstrated to be effective in many other contexts, including the consumer domain. The Cultural Heritage is one of the new application contexts and is an ideal domain to test the flexibility and quality of this new technology. This survey overviews the various fabrication technologies, discussing their strengths, limitations, and costs. Various successful uses of 3D printing in the Cultural Heritage are analysed, which should also be useful for other application contexts. We review works that have attempted to extend fabrication technologies in order to deal with the specific issues in the use of digital fabrication in the Cultural Heritage. Finally, we also propose areas for future research.","tags":null,"title":"Digital Fabrication Techniques for Cultural Heritage: A Survey","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Paolo Pingi","Eliana Siotto","Gianpaolo Palma","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"dd8690b3dc0b2e6e6dfc0f6ee4d44a7e","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2017/PSPS17/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2017/PSPS17/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Documentazione e analisi delle deformazioni del supporto ligneo e della superficie pittorica mediante rilievo 3D","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Nico Schertler","Marco Tarini","Wenzel Jakob","Misha Kazhdan","Stefan Gumhold","Daniele Panozzo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"d8222320a70e43db3b6086006826a4c6","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2017/STJKGP17/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2017/STJKGP17/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Field-aligned online surface reconstruction","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Matteo Dellepiane","Marco Callieri","Francesco Banterle","Domenico Arenga","Massimo Zallocco","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"293efd19f65c1281a9ed408a07318437","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2017/DCBAZS17/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2017/DCBAZS17/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"From Paper to Web: Automatic Generation of a Web-Accessible 3D Repository of Pottery Types","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Scopigno","Matteo Dellepiane"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"4888dd0db9ef5bc37c011ab8d48dafbe","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2017/SD17/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2017/SD17/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Integration and Analysis of Sampled Data: Visualization Approaches and Platforms","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Eliana Siotto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"2444fae9099b0b4c2e25fba21873dbc3","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2017/Sio17/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2017/Sio17/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"La policromia sui sarcofagi romani.

Tensegrities are known to be difficult to design---existing design methods are often restricted to using symmetric or templated configurations, limiting the design space to simple constructions. We introduce an algorithm to automatically create free-form stable tensegrity designs that satisfy both fabrication and geometric constraints, and faithfully approximate input geometric shapes. Our approach sidesteps the usual force-based approach in favor of a geometric optimization on the positions of the elements. Equipped with this formulation, we provide a design framework to explore the highly constrained space of tensegrity structures. We validate our method with simulations and real-world constructions.                                      Click here download the slides.

This kind of structures can be easily built in relatively unprepared sites, dismantled, transported and re-used even by not specialized handcraft. For these reasons, reciprocal structures have been widely used in the past for military purposes, and nowadays they seem to satisfy very well the different requirements of a quick and temporary shelter of a large archaeological area when they are shaped as grid shells.      This paper proposes the design of a reversible, reciprocal framed grid shell to shelter the archaeological site of the Roman Shipwrecks in Pisa. The structure must protect excavations and archaeologists from the weather and provide an easy access to visitors. Additionally, it must allow for easy disassembling and moving to another site.  The design choices aim at optimizing both structural efficiency and esthetical qualities. A parametric workflow for both the form finding and the digital fabrication processes has been developed, and a prototype of accommodative steel T-joint for timber reciprocal beams has been realized.

In computer graphics these workflows are still not well established, compared to what is done for text writing or software development. Usually artists work alone and share their final models by sending files. In this paper we present a system for collaborative 3D digital sculpting. In our prototype, multiple artists concurrently sculpt a polygonal mesh on their local machines by changing its vertex properties, such as positions and material BRDFs. Our system shares the artists' edits automatically and seamlessly merges these edits even when they happen on the same region of the surface. We propose a merge algorithm that is fast-enough for seamless collaboration, respects users' edits as much as possible, can support any sculpting operation, and works for both geometry and appearance modifications. Since in sculpting artists alternatively perform fine adjustments and large scale modifications, our algorithm is based on a multiresolution edit representation that handles concurrent overlapping edits at different scales. We tested our algorithm by modeling meshes collaboratively in different sculpting sessions and found that our algorithm outperforms prior works on collaborative mesh editing in all cases.","tags":null,"title":"cSculpt: A System for Collaborative Sculpting","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Davide Tonelli","Nico Pietroni","Paolo Cignoni","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"524db14413b2f0823f33624654fb28a3","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2016/TPCS16/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2016/TPCS16/","section":"Publication","summary":"Statics Aware Voronoi Grid-shells have been recently introduced in the Architectural Geometry field.

Such application scenarios include 3D surface reconstruction, environment monitoring, natural events management and forensic science. Unfortunately, typical 3D scanning setups cannot provide any one-to-one mapping between measured samples in static regions: in particular, both extrinsic and intrinsic sensor parameters may vary over time while sensor noise and outliers additionally corrupt the data. In this paper, we adopt a multi-scale approach to robustly tackle these issues. Starting from two point clouds, we first remove outliers using a probabilistic operator. Then, we detect the actual change using the implicit surface defined by the point clouds under a Growing Least Square reconstruction that, compared to the classical proximity measure, offers a more robust change/no-change characterization near the temporal intersection of the scans and in the areas exhibiting different sampling density and direction. The resulting classification is enhanced with a spatial reasoning step to solve critical geometric configurations that are common in man-made environments. We validate our approach on a synthetic test case and on a collection of real data sets acquired using commodity hardware. Finally, we show how 3D reconstruction benefits from the resulting precise change/no-change segmentation. \t \t EG 2016 Slides","tags":null,"title":"Detection of Geometric Temporal Changes in Point Clouds","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Fabio Ganovelli","Giovanni Pintore","Valeria Garro","Enrico Gobbetti","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"6cfc9d2969cd1a2456635617d9b14bf2","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2016/GPGGS16/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2016/GPGGS16/","section":"Publication","summary":"We present a novel algorithm for fast metric reconstruction on mobile devices using a combination of image and inertial acceleration data.

In this paper we analyse the stability of hex-dominant free-form grid-shells, generated with the Statics Aware Voronoi Remeshing scheme introduced in Pietroni et al. (2015). This is a novel hex-dominant, organic-like and non uniform remeshing pattern that manages to take into account the statics of the underlying surface. We show how this pattern is particularly suitable for free-form grid-shells, providing good performance in terms of both aesthetics and structural behaviour. To reach this goal, we select a set of four con- temporary architectural surfaces and we establish a systematic comparative analysis between Statics Aware Voronoi Grid-Shells and equivalent state of the art triangular and quadrilateral grid-shells. For each dataset and for each grid-shell topology, imperfection sensitivity analyses are carried out and the worst response diagrams compared. It turns out that, in spite of the in- trinsic weakness of the hexagonal topology, free-form Statics Aware Voronoi Grid-Shells are much more effective than their state-of-the-art quadrilateral counterparts.","tags":null,"title":"Stability of Statics Aware Voronoi Grid-Shells","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Karina Rodriguez Echavarria","Asla Medeiros e Sá","Nico Pietroni","Paolo Cignoni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"cf9ef0504d87f5a9020ec374a732c6cb","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2016/MRPC16/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2016/MRPC16/","section":"Publication","summary":"Digital fabrication technologies are becoming of importance to a number of knowledge areas and sectors, including medicine, entertainment, design, engineering, education, arts and architecture, due to their accessibility and versatility. These technolo- gies are changing the design of digital models, materials and manufacturing processes which enable to build previously un- achievable physical objects. Since many constraints imposed on the design of objects have changed significantly, a growing research community is working on graphical tools and techniques to enable the conception, automation, production and usage of innovative and complex designs for fabrication. In the present work, we survey the state of the art of computer graphics contributions to functional fabrication design tools and techniques. By functional fabrication we understand the design and manufacture of physical objects which functionalities exploit the capabilities of digital fabrication technologies. These func- tionalities include improving the mechanics of a workpiece, producing articulated models, capturing aerodynamics, planning deformable workpieces and controlling the object's appearance and acoustics. The resulting design tools are clearly taking advantage of relevant computer graphics techniques. Furthermore, they are extending these techniques to realise new physical forms as well as bringing innovation to feed into the design space.","tags":null,"title":"State Of The Art on Functional Fabrication","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Marion Lamé","Federico Ponchio","Ivan Radman-Livaja","Bruce Robertson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"ab33e7bdb13c10144dbb53419cea8955","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2016/LPRR16/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2016/LPRR16/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Teaching (Digital) Epigraphy","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Rafal  Mantiuk","Gabriel Eilertsen","Francesco Banterle","Jonas Unger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"35955fbcd026177864a81055f15ab0f3","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2016/UBEM16a/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2016/UBEM16a/","section":"Publication","summary":"abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract High dynamic range (HDR) video technology has gone through remarkable developments over the last few years; HDR-video cameras are being commercialized, new algorithms for color grading and tone mapping specifically designed for HDR-video have recently been proposed, and the first open source compression algorithms for HDR-video are becoming available.

This function is tailored for a target surface: its restriction to the surface is a parametrization exhibiting high quality, e.g. in terms of angle and area preservation; and, near the surface, it is almost constant for small orthogonal displacements.The representation is applicable to a wide range of shapes and UV-maps, and unlocks several key advantages: it removes the need to duplicate vertices in the mesh to encode cuts in the map; it makes the UV-map representation independent from the meshing of the surface; the same texture, and even the same UV-map, can be shared by multiple geometrically similar models (e.g.alllevelsofa LoDpyramid); UV-maps can be applied to representations other than polygonal meshes, like point clouds or set of registered range-maps.Our schema is cheap on GPU computational and memory resources, requiring only a single, cache-coherent indirection to a small volumetric texture per fragment.We also provide an algorithm to construct a volume-encoded UV-map given a target surface.           \t Project page (with demo, sources, etc).","tags":null,"title":"Volume-encoded UV-maps","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Fabrizio Galeazzi","Marco Callieri","Matteo Dellepiane","Michael Charmo","Julian Richards","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"62c025dbc1093533adb623820193715c","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2016/GCDCRS16/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2016/GCDCRS16/","section":"Publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Web-based visualization for 3D data in archaeology: The ADS 3D viewer","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["admin","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

The first is a multi-view segmentation algorithm that allows the user to propagate the foreground selection of one or more images both to all the images of the input set and to the 3D points, in order to accurately select the part of the scene to be reconstructed. The second is a fast GPU-based algorithm for the reconstruction of smooth surfaces from multiple views, which incorporates the hints provided by the user.

While a range of methods exist for discretizing 3D objects with an initial topologically suitable hex mesh, their output meshes frequently contain poorly shaped and even inverted elements, requiring a further quality optimization step. We introduce a novel framework for optimizing hex-mesh quality capable of generating inversion-free high-quality meshes from such poor initial inputs. We recast hex quality improvement as an optimization of the shape of overlapping cones, or unions, of tetrahedra surrounding every directed edge in the hex mesh, and show the two to be equivalent. We then formulate cone shape optimization as a sequence of convex quadratic optimization problems, where hex convexity is encoded via simple linear inequality constraints. As this solution space may be empty, we therefore present an alternate formulation which allows the solver to proceed even when constraints cannot be satisfied exactly. We iteratively improve mesh element quality by solving at each step a set of local, per-cone, convex constrained optimization problems, followed by a global energy minimization step which reconciles these local solutions. This latter method provides no theoretical guarantees on the solution but produces inversion-free, high quality meshes in practice. We demonstrate the robustness of our framework by optimizing numerous poor quality input meshes generated using a variety of initial meshing methods and producing high-quality inversion-free meshes in each case. We further validate our algorithm by comparing it against previous work, and demonstrate a significant improvement in both worst and average element quality.\n\n[ project page ] [ Video ]","tags":null,"title":"Practical Hex-Mesh Optimization via Edge-Cone Rectification","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Marco Callieri","Matteo Dellepiane","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"e7dce63ddba31fca57cfe75e047b8495","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2015/CDS15/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2015/CDS15/","section":"Publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Remote visualization and navigation of 3D models of archeological sites","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Silvia Biasotti","Andrea Cerri","Masaki Aono","A.

However, in the real world, the same basic function of applying colors onto an object is far from trivial. One can specify colors during the fabrication process using a color 3D printer, but this does not apply to already existing objects. Paint and decals can be used during post-fabrication, but they are challenging to apply on complex shapes. In this paper, we develop a method to enable texture mapping of physical objects, that is, we allow one to map an arbitrary color image onto a three-dimensional object. Our approach builds upon hydrographics, a technique to transfer pigments printed on a sheet of polymer onto curved surfaces. We first describe a setup that makes the traditional water transfer printing process more accurate and consistent across prints. We then simulate the transfer process using a specialized parameterization to estimate the mapping between the planar color map and the object surface. We demonstrate that our approach enables the application of detailed color maps onto complex shapes such as 3D models of faces and anatomical casts.","tags":null,"title":"Texture Mapping Real-World Objects with Hydrographics ","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Chiara Leoni","Marco Callieri","Matteo Dellepiane","Daniel O Donnell","Roberto Rosselli Del Turco","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"25f93d53bc46f21d70f331545bc33644","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2015/LCDORS15/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2015/LCDORS15/","section":"Publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"The Dream and the Cross: A 3D Scanning Project to Bring 3D Content in a Digital Edition","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Luigi Malomo","Francesco Banterle","Paolo Pingi","Francesco Gabellone","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" VirtualTour\n","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"9967ffc22535db3e850ac0ba87b8f7f0","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2015/MBPGS15/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2015/MBPGS15/","section":"Publication","summary":"abstract\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract In the last few years, mobile or wearable virtual reality has gained new interest amongst the industry and researchers.

The pieces are designed so that they can be represented as a simple height field and, therefore, they can be manufactured by common 3D printers without the usage of supporting material. The removal of the supporting material is often a burdensome task and may eventually damage the surface of the printed object. Our approach makes the final reproduction cheaper, accurate and suitable for the reproduction of tangible cultural heritages. Moreover, since the proposed technique decomposes the artwork in pieces, it also overcomes the working space limits of common printers. The decomposition of the input (high-resolution) triangular mesh is driven by a coarse polygonal base mesh (representing the target subdivision in pieces); the height fields defining each piece are generated by sampling distances along the normal of each face composing the base mesh. A innovative interlocking mechanism allows adjacent pieces to plug each other to compose the final shape.

The singulari- ties of the parametrization in general agree with singularities of the field, except in a small number of cases when several additional cones need to be added in a controlled way. Parametric lines can be constrained to follow an arbitrary set of feature lines on the surface. Our method is based on constructing an initial quad patch partition using robust cross-field integral line tracing. This process is fol- lowed by an algorithm modifying the quad layout structure to en- sure that consistent parametric lengths can be assigned to the edges. For most meshes, the layout modification algorithm does not add new singularities; a small number of singularities may be added to resolve an explicitly described set of layouts.

Instead than focusing on automatic, unassisted re- assembly, we targeted the scenarios where the reconstruction process is not be based on shape properties only but it is build over the experience and intuition of a CH expert. Our purpose is therefore to design a flexible interactive system, based on the selection of a set of constraints which relates different fragments, according to the understanding and experience of the CH operator. Once the user has defined those constraints, the system searches for a suitable solution, using a global energy minimization strategy that considers simultaneously all the pieces involved in the reconstruction process. Additionally, our framework provides the possibility to work in a hierarchical way, mimicking the traditional physical procedure that archaeologists use to reassemble tangible fractured objects. The frameworks is designed to work even with fragments that could have been severely damaged or eroded. On those datasets, automatic approaches may often fail, since the fractured regions do not contain enough geometric information to infer the correct matches. We present some successful uses of our framework on real application scenarios.

We analyze an input sequence of meshes with point-to-point correspondence, and we automatically produce a quadrangular mesh that fits well the input animation. We first analyze the local deformation that the surface undergoes at each point, and we initialize a cross field that remains as aligned as possible to the principal directions of deformation throughout the sequence. We then smooth this cross field based on an energy that uses a weighted combination of the initial field and the local amount of stretch. Finally, we compute a field-aligned quadrangulation with an off-the-shelf method. Our technique is fast and very simple to implement, and it significantly improves the quality of the output quad mesh and its suitability for character animation, compared to creating the quad mesh based on a single pose. We present experimental results and comparisons with a state-of-the-art quadrangulation method, on both sequences from 3D scanning and synthetic sequences obtained by a rough animation of a triangulated model.

In EnvyDepth, the user quickly indicates strokes to mark regions of the environment map that should be grouped together in a single geometric primitive. From these annotated strokes, EnvyDepth uses edit propagation to create a detailed collection of virtual point lights that reproduce both the local and the distant lighting effects in the original scene. When compared to the sole use of the distant illumination, the added spatial information better reproduces a variety of local effects such as shadows, highlights and caustics. Without the effort needed to create precise scene reconstructions, EnvyDepth annotations take only tens of seconds to produce a plausible lighting without visible artifacts. This is easy to obtain even in the case of complex scenes, both indoors and outdoors.

The employed embedding strategy is based on a decomposition of the original HDR representation into multiple low dynamic range (LDR) images by means of a bracketing process. After having inserted the selected watermark into each LDR component, the final output is generated by combining the available contributions into a single HDR object. By exploiting some of the well studied properties of digital watermarking for standard LDR images, our approach is able to generate a watermarked HDR image visually equivalent to the original one, while allowing to detect the embedded information in both the marked HDR image and in its LDR counterpart, obtained through tone-mapping operators or by extracting a specific luminance range of interest from it. Several results obtained from an extensive set of experimental tests are reported to testify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","tags":null,"title":"HDR Image Watermarking based on Bracketing Decomposition","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Lucia Arbace","Sonnino Elisabetta","Marco Callieri","Matteo Dellepiane","M.

PhotoCloud achieves scalability through a multiresolution dynamic hierarchical representation of the data, which is remotely stored and accessed by the client through an efficient cache system. The system includes a compact image browser and a multiresolution model renderer. PhotoCloud employs iconic visualization of the images in the 3D space and projects images onto the 3D scene on the fly.

In this peculiar context is very important to share the same, large data in a  web-based environment, accessing it through portable devices. Here it has to be visualized using simple and immediate interfaces, since the specific end-users are not necessary  skilled with virtual reality and 3D objects interaction. The dataset itself is not static as well as in general purpose web based  3D browsers, but dynamic and changing during the evolution of the real or simulated crisis. According with these constraints, we propose a system which simplifies location recognition and visualizes dynamically updated pictorial data inside a virtual 3D environment.  Our system is integrated in a more complex and articulated training and decision framework for emergency operations.  3DNSITE implements a novel aided intuitive interface designed to exploit touchscreen devices to  easily navigate between 3D aligned photographs.  Unlike common popular 3D maps browsers, the free 3D navigation through the whole 3D model is always  supported, assuring an interactive representation of the scenario also when no photo is available. 3DNSITE enhances already presented state-of-the-art methods for managing the data, achieving  an excellent scalability on portable devices in terms of both performance and amount of data.  The system also scales over different devices according to their hardware resources and the  available network bandwidth, exploiting a state-of-the-art multiresolution representation for  the 3D model and a multi-level cache system, employed to web access both the images and  the hierarchical 3D model structure.","tags":null,"title":"3DNSITE: A NETWORKED INTERACTIVE 3D VISUALIZATION SYSTEM TO SIMPLIFY LOCATION RECOGNITION IN CRISIS MANAGEMENT","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Banterle","Massimiliano Corsini","Paolo Cignoni","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"link to the official journal\nPiccante\nOpenGL ES 2.0 shaders source code and data\n","date":1325376e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376e3,"objectID":"e60194081afdf33372a2c0b70a094a99","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2012/BCCS12/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2012/BCCS12/","section":"Publication","summary":"abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfunction log(msg) { var textarea = document.getElementById(\"log-area\");

(A vertex seam is a vertex duplication of a polygonal mesh with different texture coordinates assigned to the two geometrically coinciding copies.) As a result, the method leads to simpler, leaner, replication-free data structures. Is also allows for a higher degree of proceduralism in generation of texture coordinates. The method is general, trivial to implement (exhaustive pseudocode is provided), very low in cost on resources (with a virtually null impact on performance), and it leverages only basic mechanisms widely available in most GPU implementations.    An open-source implementation is available online.","tags":null,"title":"Cylindrical and Toroidal Parameterizations Without Vertex Seams","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Banterle","Alessandro Artusi","Elena Sikudova","Thomas Edward William Bashford-Rogers","Patrick Ledda","Marina Bloj","Alan Chalmers"],"categories":null,"content":"HDR Toolbox\n","date":1325376e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376e3,"objectID":"537cc6ab181461408dd742f1b6dad9b8","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2012/BASBLBC12/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2012/BASBLBC12/","section":"Publication","summary":"abstract\n\n\n\n\n\nSource code in the HDR Toolbox (BanterleTMO.m)\nAbstract In this paper we present a new technique for the display of High Dynamic Range (HDR) images on Low Dynamic Range (LDR) displays. The described process has three stages. First, the input image is segmented into luminance zones. Second, the tone mapping operator (TMO) that performs better in each zone is automatically selected. Finally, the resulting tone mapping (TM) outputs for each zone are merged, generating the final LDR output image. To establish the TMO that performs better in each luminance zone we conducted a preliminary psychophysical experiment using a set of HDR images and six different TMOs. We validated our composite technique on several (new) HDR images and conducted a further psychophysical experiment, using an HDR display as reference, that establishes the advantages of our hybrid three-stage approach over a traditional individual TMO.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic description of our Framework.

The retarget display has different features from the target one such as: dynamic range, discretization levels, color gamut, multi-view (3D), refresh rate, spatial resolution... This is a very relevant and hot topic in graphics, given the increasing number of display devices, from large, high-contrast screens to small cell phones with limited dynamic range; a lot of techniques are being published in different venues, and it's simply very hard to keep up.   For instance, one of the few cases for which retargeting can be potentially straightforward is when adapting images from a larger display (in term of resolution) to a smaller one with the same aspect ratio: a low-pass filter followed by downsampling can then achieve good quality results. However, for most cases retargeting can be an ill-posed problem, such as when displaying Low Dynamic Range (LDR) or 8-bit content on High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays. Such a problem requires the retargeting algorithm to generate new content which is missing in the input image/frame.   In this course, we will present the latest solutions and techniques for retargeting images along various dimensions such as dynamic range, colors, temporal and spatial resolutions, and offer for the first time a much-needed holistic view of the field. Moreover, we are going to show how to measure and analyze the changes applied to an image/video in terms of quality using both (subjective) psychophysical experiments and (objective) computational metrics.    The course should be of interest to anyone involved in graphics in its broader sense, given the almost unavoidable need to retarget results to different devices: from developer that are interested to implement retargeting techniques, to users that just need an overall perspective, for researchers fully engaged in developing multi-dimensional retargeting techniques, for whom this course will serve as a solid background for future algorithms.\n\n\n\nSyllabus:\nIntroduction by Francesco Banterle Dynamic Range Retargeting: Tone Mapping by Rafal Mantiuk Dynamic Range Retargeting: Cornsweet Illusion and Glare in Tone Mapping by Tobias Ritschel Dynamic Range Retargeting: The Color Issue by Alessandro Artusi Dynamic Range Retargeting: Reverse/Inverse Tone Mapping by Francesco Banterle Spatial Image Retargeting by Diego Gutierrez Temporal Image Retargeting by Elmar Eisemann and Tobias Ritschel Quality Metrics by Tunc Aydin Stereo Retargeting by Piotr Didyk","tags":null,"title":"Mapping images to target devices: spatial, temporal, stereo, tone, and color","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Fabio Ganovelli","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1325376e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376e3,"objectID":"8e4d778b373927c888d16cb492ceeb1e","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2012/GS12/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2012/GS12/","section":"Publication","summary":"OCME (Out-of-Core Mesh Editing) is a novel data-structure  and related algorithms for out-of-core editing of large meshes.

To separate these two reflection components may help applications which need consistent object surface appearance. In fact, many algorithms used in numerous tasks of computer vision, computer graphics and image processing,  work under the assumption of perfect Lambertian surfaces (or perfect diffuse reflection). They consider specular pixels (or highlights) as outliers or noise. Moreover, the two reflection components can be processed separately and afterwards recombined to produce particular visual effects [MZK*06] (dichromatic editing  Figure.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Example of an image where the presence of highlights generates the loss of details and colour information. Details and colours are completely washed out in the highlights region.\n\n\n\nSeveral specularity removal techniques are available in literature; they differ in the information they use and in how it is used. Table 1 summarises how these techniques may be classified and in which paragraph of this survey they are explained. The notation used in Table 1 for the categories is the following: CSA, colour space analysis; NA, neighbourhood analysis; POL, polarization; IS, image sequences; MFI, multiple-flash images.

An alternative approach is to move to the 2D space, resolving shape reasoning to easier image processing techniques. In this paper we propose a novel framework for the analysis of 2D information distributed over 3D geometry, based on a locally smooth parametrization technique that allows us to treat local 3D data in terms of image content.

Computing such global seamless parameterization makes it possible to perform quad remeshing, texture mapping and texture  synthesis and many other types of geometry processing operations. Our approach is based on a formulation of the Poisson equation on a manifold structure defined for the surface by the range images.

The retarget display has different features from the target one such as: dynamic range, discretization levels, color gamut, multi-view (3D), refresh rate, spatial resolution... This is a very relevant and hot topic in graphics, given the increasing number of display devices, from large, high-contrast screens to small cell phones with limited dynamic range; a lot of techniques are being published in different venues, and it's simply very hard to keep up.   For instance, one of the few cases for which retargeting can be potentially straightforward is when adapting images from a larger display (in term of resolution) to a smaller one with the same aspect ratio: a low-pass filter followed by downsampling can then achieve good quality results. However, for most cases retargeting can be an ill-posed problem, such as when displaying Low Dynamic Range (LDR) or 8-bit content on High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays. Such a problem requires the retargeting algorithm to generate new content which is missing in the input image/frame.   In this course, we will present the latest solutions and techniques for retargeting images along various dimensions such as dynamic range, colors, temporal and spatial resolutions, and offer for the first time a much-needed holistic view of the field. Moreover, we are going to show how to measure and analyze the changes applied to an image/video in terms of quality using both (subjective) psychophysical experiments and (objective) computational metrics.    The course should be of interest to anyone involved in graphics in its broader sense, given the almost unavoidable need to retarget results to different devices: from developer that are interested to implement retargeting techniques, to users that just need an overall perspective, for researchers fully engaged in developing multi-dimensional retargeting techniques, for whom this course will serve as a solid background for future algorithms.\n\n\n\nSyllabus:\nIntroduction by Francesco Banterle Dynamic Range Retargeting: Tone Mapping by Rafal Mantiuk Dynamic Range Retargeting: Cornsweet Illusion and Glare in Tone Mapping by Karol Myszkowski Dynamic Range Retargeting: The Color Issue by Alessandro Artusi Dynamic Range Retargeting: Reverse/Inverse Tone Mapping by Francesco Banterle Spatial Image Retargeting by Diego Gutierrez Temporal Image Retargeting by Elmar Eisemann and Karol Myszkowski Quality Metrics by Tunc Aydin Stereo Retargeting by Piotr Didyk","tags":null,"title":"Multidimensional Image Retargeting","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Marco Callieri","Antoni Chica","Matteo Dellepiane","Isaac Besora","Massimiliano Corsini","Jordi Moyés","Guido Ranzuglia","Roberto Scopigno","Pere Brunet"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":129384e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":129384e4,"objectID":"66e6dbf099a07148e6dd7349ceeb45f7","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2011/CCDBCMRSB11/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2011/CCDBCMRSB11/","section":"Publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Multiscale acquisition and presentation of very large artifacts: The case of Portalada","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Franco Mosca","Andrea Pietrabissa","Fabio Ganovelli","Giuseppe Megali","Nico Pietroni","Giuseppe Turini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":129384e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":129384e4,"objectID":"b93c8a868fd90bb3ed53e31e2a9f77dd","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2011/TPMGPM11/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2011/TPMGPM11/","section":"Publication","summary":"In the recent decades robotics and computer science have been  gaining more and more relevance in all aspects of our lives. In surgery, for  example, they gave birth to procedures, impossible to perform otherwise, like  the tele-surgery or the nano-surgery. On this regard, these applied sciences  already play an important role in assisting the surgeon both in the operative  room and, as a support, in the education of young surgeons, but much work has  still to be done.  In fact in these last years we have seen an extreme change in the traditional  training in surgery and the computer-based simulation is one of the main reason  of this shift. The spread of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) has brought  major improvements in the quality of healthcare, but it has also increased the  complexity of the surgical procedures requiring advanced and highly  specialized training systems. Moreover these training procedures need to be  reiterated during the operational life of surgeons. Therefore, considering the  limited availability of cadavers and the public concern with the non-ethical  treatment of animals, the traditional approaches to surgical training are  drastically limited encouraging the use of surgical simulators based on virtual  environments.  Healthcare industries and the scientific community in medicine agree  indicating the disruptive potential of the application of Virtual Reality (VR) to  the training in the medical field. Therefore the next step is the development of  surgical simulators with an high level of realism in order to practice complex  procedures in a safe environment. Moreover it is decisive that this evolution is  done integrating advanced medical imaging and processing, allowing surgeons  to practice simulated interventions on patient specific dataset.  The increasing importance of MIS techniques will cause a drastic change in  pre-operation planning and basic surgical training. In fact, the features of this  kind of surgical approach (the workspace limitation, the 2D vision through a  laparoscopic camera and the indirect physical interaction with the patient body)  make it possible to use a surgical simulator to train, plan or simulate an  intervention, reproducing the visual and tactile feedback of the real surgical  procedure on a real patient.  This paper presents some research and applicative results on Computer  Assisted Surgery (CAS) achieved in the framework of EndoCAS, a newly  founded Center of Excellence in Pisa. The research has involved: the  development of segmentation algorithms for volumetric datasets, the simulation  of bone drilling procedures, the modeling of deformable object cuts and  deformations and the simulation of rope interactions during a suture procedure  in MIS. All these projects were been developed using a new open source library  to support the implementation of techniques for simulating deformable objects.  Our purpose is to enhance the surgical training with new improved  techniques applied both to the medical imaging and to the computer-based  simulation in order to carry the surgical training to a next level of realism.","tags":null,"title":"New techniques for computer-based simulation in surgical training","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Marco Callieri","Paolo Cignoni","Matteo Dellepiane","Guido Ranzuglia","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":129384e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":129384e4,"objectID":"82b0ce6bd0641d2aa4a8825a95729df0","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2011/CCDRS11/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2011/CCDRS11/","section":"Publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Processing a Complex Architectural Sampling with MeshLab: the case of Piazza Della Signoria","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Marco Callieri","Matteo Dellepiane","Paolo Cignoni","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":129384e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":129384e4,"objectID":"ed3ef6cdbd70f80c6c65cdb57a704ff6","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2011/CDCS11/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2011/CDCS11/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Processing sampled 3D data: reconstruction and visualization technologies","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Marco Tarini","Enrico Puppo","Daniele Panozzo","Nico Pietroni","Paolo Cignoni"],"categories":null,"content":" Talk Slides ","date":129384e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":129384e4,"objectID":"67ce42400bf1d79a1ecd8f1eeb282aec","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2011/TPPPC11/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2011/TPPPC11/","section":"Publication","summary":"We present a method for the global parametrization of meshes that preserves alignment to a cross field in input     while obtaining a parametric domain made of few coarse axis-aligned rectangular patches,which form an abstract     base complex without T-junctions.

The domain is a collection of equilateral triangular 2D regions enriched with explicit adjacency relationships (it is abstract in the sense that no 3D embedding is necessary). It is tailored to minimize isometric distor tion, resulting in excellent parameterization qualities, even when meshes with complex shape and topology are mapped into domains composed of a small number of large continuous regions. Moreover, this domain is in turn remapped into a collection of 2D square regions, unlocking many advantages found in quad-based domains (e.g. ease of packing).

However, this approach does not scale well with the size of the datasets (number of images). In this paper, we propose a new thumbnail-based interface to browse large collections of images. Our approach is based on weighted centroidal anisotropic Voronoi diagrams. A dynamically changing subset of images is represented by thumbnails and shown on the screen. Thumbnails are shaped like general polygons, to better cover screen space, while still reflecting the original aspect ratios or orientation of the represented images. During the browsing process, thumbnails are dynamically rearranged, reshaped and rescaled. The objective is to devote more screen space (more numerous and larger thumbnails) to the parts of the dataset closer to the current region of interest, and progressively lesser away from it, while still making the dataset visible as a whole.

A number of recent algorithms for conversion of arbitrary meshes to regularly sampled form (typically quadrangulation) aim to align the resulting mesh with feature lines of the geometry. While resulting in a substantial improvement in mesh quality, feature alignment makes it difficult to obtain coarse regular patch partitions of the mesh. In this paper, we propose an approach to constructing patch layouts consisting of small numbers of quadrilateral patches while maintaining good feature alignment. To achieve this, we use quadrilateral T-meshes, for which the intersection of two faces may not be the whole edge or vertex, but a part of an edge. T-meshes offer more flexibility for reduction of the number of patches and vertices in a base domain while maintaining alignment with geometric features. At the same time, T-meshes retain many desirable features of quadrangulations, allowing construction of high-order representations, easy packing of regularly sampled geometric data into textures, as well as supporting different types of discretizations for physical simulation.\nTalk Slides","tags":null,"title":"Feature-aligned T-meshes","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Gianpaolo Palma","Marco Callieri","Matteo Dellepiane","Massimiliano Corsini","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304e3,"objectID":"f71c04eeaad75b8ad237d95692ea351f","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2010/PCDCS10/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2010/PCDCS10/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Geometry-Aware Video Registration","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Matteo Dellepiane","Marco Callieri","Massimiliano Corsini","Paolo Cignoni","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1262304e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304e3,"objectID":"25c198b99f400efd17bde47074e37552","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2010/DCCCS10/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2010/DCCCS10/","section":"Publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Improved Color Acquisition and Mapping on 3D Models via Flash-Based Photography","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Gianpaolo Palma","Massimiliano Corsini","Matteo Dellepiane","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304e3,"objectID":"c58a5eea4d87dad993c4f14793067685","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2010/PCDS10/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2010/PCDS10/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Improving 2D-3D registration by mutual information using gradient maps","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Michele Sottile","Matteo Dellepiane","Paolo Cignoni","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1262304e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304e3,"objectID":"f2241cdf6eaafb9a9a8f634eac742445","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2010/SDCS10/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2010/SDCS10/","section":"Publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Mutual Correspondences: an hybrid method for image-to-geometry registration","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Marco Tarini","Nico Pietroni","Paolo Cignoni","Daniele Panozzo","Enrico Puppo"],"categories":null,"content":" Talk Slides Here some downloadable data for comparisons Here some comparison with other quad mesh simplification methods\n","date":1262304e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304e3,"objectID":"12c235eef2566bded177f8e0e10b79c2","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2010/TPCPP10/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2010/TPCPP10/","section":"Publication","summary":"In this paper we present an innovative approach to incremental quad mesh simplification, i.e. the task of producing a low complexity quad mesh starting from a high complexity one. The process is based on a novel set of strictly local operations which preserve quad structure. We show how good tessellation quality (e.g. in terms of vertex valencies) can be achieved by pursuing uniform length and canonical proportions of edges and diagonals. The decimation process is interleaved with smoothing in tangent space. The latter strongly contributes to identify a suitable sequence of local modification operations. The method is naturally extended to manage preservation of feature lines (e.g. creases) and varying (e.g. adaptive) tessellation densities.

The developed technique is based on an adaptive volumetric point sampling, done in a preprocessing stage, which associates to each sample the optical depth for a predefined set of directions. This information is then used by a rendering algorithm that combines the objectÃ­s surface rasterization with a ray tracing algorithm, implemented on the graphics processor, to compose the final image. This approach allows us to simulate light scattering phenomena for inhomogeneous isotropic materials in real time with an arbitrary number of light sources.

Solid textures are an efficient instrument to compactly represent both the external and internal appearance of 3D objects, providing practical advantages with respect to classical 2D texturing. Recently, several methods have been proposed to synthesize solid textures. For some of those, which are commonly referred as procedural, colors are obtained by means of functions that algorithmically encode appearance and structure properties of the texture. Alternatively, example-based methods aim to capture and replicate the appearance as described by a set of input exemplars. Within this framework, we propose a novel classification of solid texture synthesis methods: boundary-independent and boundarydependent methods. In the case of boundary-independent methods, the shape of the object to be textured is irrelevant and texture information can be freely generated for each point in the space. Conversely, boundary-dependent methods conform the synthesis process to the actual shape of the object, so that they can exploit this information to orient and guide the texture generation. For better understanding the different algorithms proposed in the literature, we first provide a short introduction on 2D texture synthesis methods, focusing on the main principles which are also exploited for 3D texture synthesis. We review the different methodologies by considering their strengths and weaknesses, the class of appearances they can successfully synthesize, and failure cases. In particular, we focus our attention on advantages and drawbacks of boundary-independent methods with respect to boundary-dependent ones.\nThis PDF contains the Author version, you can downlaod the

paper presents the Splitting Cubes, a fast and robust technique to perform interactive virtual cutting on deformable ob jects.  The technique relies on two ideas. The Þrst one is to embed the deformable ob ject in a regular grid,  to apply the deformation function to the grid nodes and to interpolate the deformation inside each cell from its 8 nodes. The second idea is to produce a tessellation for the boundary of the ob ject on the base  of the intersections of such boundary with the edges of the grid. Please note that the boundary can be  expressed in any way, for example it can be a triangle mesh, an implicit or a parametric surface. The only requirement is that the intersection between the boundary and the grid edges can be computed.  This paper shows how the interpolation of the deformation inside the cells can be used to produce  discontinuities in the deformation function, and the intersections of the cut surface can be used to  visually show the cuts on the object. The Splitting Cubes is essentially a tessellation algorithm for growing, deformable surface and it can be applied to any method for animating deformable ob jects. In this paper the case of the mesh-free methods (MMs) is considered: in this context, we decribed a practical GPU friendly method, that we named the Extended Visibility criterion, to introduce discontinuities of the deformation.","tags":null,"title":"Splitting Cubes a Fast and Robust technique for Virtual Cutting","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Denis Pitzalis","Paolo Cignoni","M.

fidelity and interactivity are the main goals in Computer Graphics research, but recently also audio is assuming an important role. Binaural rendering can provide extremely pleasing and realistic three-dimensional sound, but to achieve best results it's necessary either to measure or to estimate individual Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF). This function is strictly related to the peculiar features of ears and face of the listener. Recent sound scattering simulation techniques can calculate HRTF starting from an accurate 3D model of a human head. Hence, the use of binaural rendering on large scale (i.e. video games, entertainment) could depend on the possibility to produce a sufficiently accurate 3D model of a human head, starting from the smallest possible input. In this paper we present a completely automatic system, which produces a 3D model of a head starting from simple input data (five photos and some key-points indicated by user). The geometry is generated by extracting information from images and accordingly deforming a 3D dummy to reproduce user head features. The system proves to be fast, automatic, robust and reliable: geometric validation and preliminary assessments show that it can be accurate enough for HRTF calculation.\n\nTalk Slides","tags":null,"title":"Reconstructing head models from photographs for individualized 3D-audio processing","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Paolo Cignoni","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"db7a057788c930bf63d8cbe7b8d0529f","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2008/CS08/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2008/CS08/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Sampled 3D models for CH applications: an enabling medium or a technological exercise?","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Massimiliano Corsini","Marco Callieri","Paolo Cignoni"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"13c7a4b0605784766e03291cfdbee215","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2008/CCC08/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2008/CCC08/","section":"Publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Stereo Light Probe","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Olivier Balet","J.

In surgery, for  example, they gave birth to procedures, impossible to perform otherwise, like  the tele-surgery or the nano-surgery. On this regard, these applied sciences  already play an important role in assisting the surgeon both in the operative  room and, as a support, in the education of young surgeons, but much work has  still to be done.  In fact in these last years we have seen an extreme change in the traditional  training in surgery and the computer-based simulation is one of the main reason  of this shift. The spread of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) has brought  major improvements in the quality of healthcare, but it has also increased the  complexity of the surgical procedures requiring advanced and highly  specialized training systems. Moreover these training procedures need to be  reiterated during the operational life of surgeons. Therefore, considering the  limited availability of cadavers and the public concern with the non-ethical  treatment of animals, the traditional approaches to surgical training are  drastically limited encouraging the use of surgical simulators based on virtual  environments.  Healthcare industries and the scientific community in medicine agree  indicating the disruptive potential of the application of Virtual Reality (VR) to  the training in the medical field. Therefore the next step is the development of  surgical simulators with an high level of realism in order to practice complex  procedures in a safe environment. Moreover it is decisive that this evolution is  done integrating advanced medical imaging and processing, allowing surgeons  to practice simulated interventions on patient specific dataset.  The increasing importance of MIS techniques will cause a drastic change in  pre-operation planning and basic surgical training. In fact, the features of this  kind of surgical approach (the workspace limitation, the 2D vision through a  laparoscopic camera and the indirect physical interaction with the patient body)  make it possible to use a surgical simulator to train, plan or simulate an  intervention, reproducing the visual and tactile feedback of the real surgical  procedure on a real patient.  This paper presents some research and applicative results on Computer  Assisted Surgery (CAS) achieved in the framework of EndoCAS, a newly  founded Center of Excellence in Pisa. The research has involved: the  development of segmentation algorithms for volumetric datasets, the simulation  of bone drilling procedures, the modeling of deformable object cuts and  deformations and the simulation of rope interactions during a suture procedure  in MIS. All these projects were been developed using a new open source library  to support the implementation of techniques for simulating deformable objects.  Our purpose is to enhance the surgical training with new improved  techniques applied both to the medical imaging and to the computer-based  simulation in order to carry the surgical training to a next level of realism.","tags":null,"title":"New techniques for computer-based simulation in surgical training","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Valentino Fiorin","Paolo Cignoni","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"352702f92c37f8c37ec4d9f62f7516ef","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2007/FCS07/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2007/FCS07/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Out-of-core MLS reconstruction","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"c83b01478308c945210074d2000338b8","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2007/Sco07/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2007/Sco07/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Processing methodologies and interactive visualization of 3D scanned architectures","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Paolo Cignoni","Marco Di Benedetto","Fabio Ganovelli","Enrico Gobbetti","Fabio Marton","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"bfc2d7008b62817adff3f2cf36f6d62e","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2007/CDGGMS07/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2007/CDGGMS07/","section":"Publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Ray-Casted BlockMaps for Large Urban Models Streaming and Visualization","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Giuseppe Turini","Nico Pietroni","Fabio Ganovelli","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"277254c8a5e86552ad103dbb0631d39b","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2007/TPGS07/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2007/TPGS07/","section":"Publication","summary":"In the recent decades robotic and computer science have been gaining more and more relevance in all aspects of our lives.

This paper presents some research and applicative results on Computer Assisted Surgery achieved in the framework of Endocas, a newly founded Center of Excellence in Pisa: A method for segmentation of anatomic parts from 3D dataset able to recover shapes from noisy 3D dataset; A technique for simulating bone drilling using a adaptive decomposition of tetrahedral meshes; A new open source library to support the implementation of techniques for simulating deformable objects.","tags":null,"title":"Techniques for Computer Assisted Surgery","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Nico Pietroni","Miguel A.

When the internal surfaces of the 3D model are revealed as it is cut, carved, or simply clipped, we synthesize their texture from the input photographs. Our texture synthesis algorithm is best classified as a morphing technique, which efficiently outputs the texture attributes of each surface point on demand. For determining source points and their weights in the morphing algorithm, we propose an interpolation domain based on BSP trees that naturally resembles planar splitting of real objects. In the context of the interpolation domain, we define efficient warping and morphing operations that allow for real-time synthesis of textures. Overall, our modeling paradigm, together with its realization through our texture synthesis algorithm, allow users to author 3D models that reveal highly realistic internal surfaces in a variety of artistic flavors.\nTalk Slides","tags":null,"title":"Texturing Internal Surfaces from a Few Cross Sections","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Matteo Dellepiane","Marco Callieri","Mark Fondersmith","Paolo Cignoni","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"d48b1e21923558664049ef8665508dcd","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2007/DCFCS07/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2007/DCFCS07/","section":"Publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Using 3D scanning to analyze a proposal for the attribution of a bronze horse to Leonardo da Vinci","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Michele Brunetti","Marco Callieri","Benedetto Pizzo","Claudio Montani","Paolo Pingi","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"b59a7e8d2ab65d3684620828509f0c52","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2007/BCPMPS07/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2007/BCPMPS07/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Using 3D scanning to monitor wood deformations and to evaluate preservation strategies","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Massimiliano Corsini","Elisa Drelie Gelasca","Touradj Ebrahimi","Mauro Barni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"dc3215b847f333569a0fbccd12506d1d","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2007/CDEB07/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2007/CDEB07/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Watermarked 3D Mesh Quality Assessment","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Marco Callieri","Paul Debevec","Jarrel Pair","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"4fec4558698292188883f9aa918711f5","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2006/CDPS06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2006/CDPS06/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A realtime immersive application with realistic lighting: the Parthenon","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Marco Tarini","Paolo Cignoni","Claudio Montani"],"categories":null,"content":" QuteMol\nqutemol.sourceforge.net\n","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"3a4ea03c887960f00be9c5e16fc9cdfa","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2006/TCM06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2006/TCM06/","section":"Publication","summary":"The paper presents a set of combined techniques to enhance the real-time visualization of simple or complex molecules (up to order of $10^6$ atoms) space fill mode.

The technique, called Compressed Batched Dynamic Adaptive Meshes (C-BDAM), is an extension of the BDAM and P-BDAM chunked level-of-detail hierarchy. In the C-BDAM approach, all patches share the same regular triangulation connectivity and incrementally encode their vertex attributes using a quantized representation of the difference with respect to values predicted from the coarser level. The structure provides a number of benefits: simplicity of data structures, overall geometric continuity for planar and spherical domains, support for variable resolution input data, management of multiple vertex attributes, efficient compression and fast construction times, ability to support maximum-error metrics, real-time decompression and shaded rendering with configurable variable level-of-detail extraction, and runtime detail synthesis. The efficiency of the approach and the achieved compression rates are demonstrated on a number of test cases, including the interactive visualization of a 29 gigasample reconstruction of the whole planet Earth created from high resolution SRTM data.","tags":null,"title":"C-BDAM - Compressed Batched Dynamic Adaptive Meshes for Terrain Rendering","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Marco Callieri","Federico Ponchio","Paolo Cignoni","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"f81f000f3d57ec3967d94739f8454e64","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2006/CPCS06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2006/CPCS06/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Easy Access to Huge 3D Models of Works of Art","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Scopigno","Marco Callieri","Massimiliano Corsini","Matteo Dellepiane"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"e650fadc02d602aebf3d1428676ad12f","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2006/DCCS06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2006/DCCS06/","section":"Publication","summary":"Reflection Transformation Imaging has proved to be a powerful method to acquire and represent the 3D reflectance properties of an object, displaying them as a 2D image. Recently, Polynomial Texture Maps (PTM), which are relightable images created from a set of photos of the object taken under several different lighting conditions, have been used in Cultural Heritage field to document and virtually inspect several sets of small objects, such as cuneiform tablets and coins. In this paper we explore the possibility of producing high quality PTM of medium or large size objects. The aim is to analyze the acquisition pipeline, resolving all the issues related to the size of the object, and the conditions of acquisition. We will discuss issues regarding acquisition planning and data gathering. We also present a new tool to interactively browse high resolution PTMs. Moreover, we perform some quality assessment considerations, in order to study the degradation of quality of the PTMs respect to the number and position of lights used to acquire the PTM. The results of our acquisition system are presented with some examples of PTMs of large artifacts like a sarcophagus of 2.4 $\\times$ 1 m size. PTM can be a good alternative to 3D scanning for capturing and representing certain class of objects, like bas-relieves, having lower costs in terms of acquisition equipment and data processing time.","tags":null,"title":"High Quality PTM Acquisition: Reflection Transformation Imaging for Large Objects","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Marcello Balzani","Claudio Montani","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"158a7c18e3aad7cc0b286a83820520f7","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2006/BMSP06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2006/BMSP06/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Il rilievo laser scanner terrestre come integrazione dei sistemi informativi di documentazione storica e di restauro","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Guido Ranzuglia","Paolo Cignoni","Fabio Ganovelli","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"656edfa972581c8a57b6854502d77c9f","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2006/RCGS06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2006/RCGS06/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Implementing Mesh-Based Approaches for deformable Objects on GPU","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Marcello Balzani","Federico Uccelli","Roberto Scopigno","Claudio Montani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"b006f485985f43ab6809087aaa57421a","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2006/BUSM06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2006/BUSM06/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"La Cattedrale di Pisa nella Piazza dei Miracoli: un rilievo 3D per l’integrazione con i sistemi informativi di documentazione storica e di restauro","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Marcello Balzani","Federico Uccelli","Roberto Scopigno","Claudio Montani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"e8b6fcd486a4101f27f79fde1b30da3c","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2006/BUSM06a/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2006/BUSM06a/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"La Cattedrale di Pisa: Un rilievo 3D per l'integrazione con i sistemi informativi di documentazione storica e di restauro","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Andrea Spinelli","Fabio Ganovelli","Claudio Montani","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"fa86cd1b6085fa66f057ba9ce67cf9e4","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2006/SGMS06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2006/SGMS06/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Recovering 3D Architectural Information from Dense Digital Models of Buildings","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Massimiliano Corsini","Matteo Dellepiane","Marco Callieri","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"bf6935a20f80aa3386e2e54d24849fd3","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2006/CDCS06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2006/CDCS06/","section":"Publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Reflection Transformation Imaging on Larger Objects: an Alternative Method for Virtual Representation","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Giuseppe Turini","Fabio Ganovelli","Claudio Montani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"bc4d13136e7a3ea9d774dd1942054e0a","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2006/TGM06/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2006/TGM06/","section":"Publication","summary":"Bone drilling is a fundamental task in several surgical procedures, including mastoidectomy, cochlear implantation, orbital surgery. It consists in eroding the part of the bone in contact with the tip of the surgical tool when a sufficient pressure is exerted. Since the bone is an almost rigid material, the bone drilling simulations usually employ voxel-based representations of the bone, so that it is easy to show material removal by playing with material density in the voxels. Unfortunately, there are cases in which drilling is only a part of the task, and parts of the same object are also cut away or, worse, the bone is slightly deformable and therefore voxel-based representations do not work well. We propose a novel method to simulate drilling on objects represented explicitly by means of a tetrahedral mesh. The key idea of our method is to create an alternative representation of the tetrahedron when it is partially eroded. Such representation consists of a set of smaller tetrahedra obtained by a hierarchical decomposition of the original one, and combined to represent the current status of the erosion.","tags":null,"title":"Simulating Drilling on Tetrahedral Meshes","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Gerhard Wolf","Roberto Sigismondi","Roberto Scopigno","Matteo Scognamiglio","Claudio

map registration is still the most time consuming phase in the processing of 3D scanning data. This is because real scanning sets are composed of hundreds of range maps and their registration is still partially manual. We propose a new method to manage complex scan sets acquired by following a regular scanner pose pattern. Our goal is to define an initial adjacency graph by coarsely aligning couples of range maps that we know are partially overlapping thanks to the adopted scanning strategy. For a pair of partially overlapping range maps, our iterative solution locates pairs of correspondent vertices through the computation of a regular n×n kernel which takes into account vertex normals and is defined in the 2D space of the range map (represented in implicit 2D format rather than as a triangle mesh in 3D space). The shape-characterization kernel and the metrics defined give a sufficiently accurate shape matching, which has been proven to fit well the requirements of automatic registration. This initial set of adjacency arcs can then be augmented by the automatic identification of the other significant arcs, by adopting a criterion based on approximate range map overlap computation. With respect to the solutions present in literature, the simplifications and assumptions adopted make our solution specifically oriented to complex 3D scanning campaigns (hundreds of range maps). The proposed method can coarsely register range maps in parallel with the acquisition activity and this is a valuable help in assessing on site the completeness of the sampling of large objects.","tags":null,"title":"Exploiting the scanning sequence for automatic registration of large sets of range maps","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Rita Borgo","Matteo Dellepiane","Paolo Cignoni","Laura Papaleo","Michela Spagnuolo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"834f080d5848a5eae1053b57faceeee0","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2005/BDCPS05/","publishdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2005/BDCPS05/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Extracting Meta-Information From 3-Dimensional Shapes With Protégé","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Riccardo Scateni","Paolo Cignoni","Claudio Montani","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"9242281845b4bda499c4fd127efd7cf2","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2005/SCMS05/","publishdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2005/SCMS05/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Fondamenti di Grafica Tridimensionale Interattiva","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Paolo Cignoni","Claudio Rocchini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"bdae7fc6a87fe4dca9b8c9409400b173","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2005/CR05a/","publishdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2005/CR05a/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Generating random points in a tetrahedron","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"8c861f3ebef726e8f94113d7c3fc9206","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2005/Sco05/","publishdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2005/Sco05/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Gestione Efficiente dei Dati Prodotti dai Sistemi di Scansione Tridimensionale","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Clara Baracchini","Andrea Brogi","Marco Callieri","Lucia Capitani","Paolo Cignoni","Andrea Fasano","Claudio Montani","C.

It consists in a standard signal texture, plus a second texture we call pinchmap, which encodes discontinuities along generally curved lines; this structure is stored in texture memory as a pair of images and is effciently interpreted on commodity graphic hardware in the fragment shader. We also present a fully automatic way to compute a pinchmap and signal texture pair from an much higher resolution image. We show that the final effect on the screen is a comparable visual quality, for a fraction of the texture storage cost and a very small impact on performance.","tags":null,"title":"Pinchmaps: Textures with Customizable Discontinuities","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Scopigno","Paolo Cignoni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"a99e42971e45cde96b8f6768c80fc629","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2005/SC05/","publishdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2005/SC05/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Processing huge scanned datasets: issues and solutions","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Marco Callieri","Paul Debevec","Jarrel Pair","Roberto Scopigno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"bba93e4ed8e4094135e93317944bf788","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2005/CDPS05/","publishdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2005/CDPS05/","section":"Publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Realistic realtime illumination of complex environment for immersive systems a case study: the Parthenon","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Nico Pietroni","Andrea Giachetti","Fabio Ganovelli"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"ca5834a61b53e2556d85f3e26d1357bd","permalink":"http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publication/2005/PGG05/","publishdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Publication/2005/PGG05/","section":"Publication","summary":"Computer assisted medical applications require often the reconstruction of anatomical structures to compute parameters useful for diagnosis or interventional planning. From CT and MRI datasets it is possible to obtain surface models of the organs of interest with a variety of algorithms, like Marching Cubes, level sets or deformable parametric surfaces. Each technique has advantages but also drawbacks like noise sensitivity (isosurface extraction), risk of leakages (level sets), oversmoothing and impossible handling of topological changes (Deformable models). To obtain a good trade-off between robustness, shape constraints and topological control, we propose a 3D balloon/isosurface method joining the advantages in curvature control, leakage penalization and efficiency of parametric surfaces with a fast re-parametrization handling topological changes. It is based on the control of surface self-intersections, freezing of the intersected nodes and replacement of the final mesh with an isosurface computed on a field representing the signed distance from the true surface.","tags":null,"title":"Robust segmentation of anatomical structures with deformable surfaces and marching cubes","type":"Publication"},{"authors":["Michael S.
