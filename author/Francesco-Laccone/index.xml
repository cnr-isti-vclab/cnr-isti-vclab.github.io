This was exploited both in creating tools for data processing and visualization of data, and in practical experience in the context of important acquisition campaigns and several pioneering international projects. Activity on 3D acquisition started at VC Lab on mid &amp;rsquo;90s; we have designed a low-cost 3D scanner and proposed many new algorithms for processing sampled 3D data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of those results later on have been incorporated in the MeshLab system, together with other geometry processing results. MeshLab is an open source system for processing and editing 3D triangular meshes; it has more than 10 years of life and a very consolidated and wide community of users (totalling more than 100,000 download every year).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have been also active on some advanced 2D media, such as the Reflection Transformation Images (RTI):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We present below links and brief presentation of some recent results.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
