I am a permanent researcher at the Visual Computing Lab - ISTI CNR.

My reserach interests are the acquisition, processing, and analysis of 3D/2D data to improve their use and understanding. I am working on 3D scanning, acquisition and modelling of real object surface appearance, analysis and visualization of the temporal 3D data for automatic change detection, non-rigid registration of 3D raw acquired data, approximation of the global illumination effects for real time rendering, user interface for Virtual Reality, web visualization of 3D/2D data.
