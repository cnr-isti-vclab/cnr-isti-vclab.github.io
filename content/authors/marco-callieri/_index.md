I am a Senior Researcher at the Visual Computing Lab of ISTI-CNR (institute of Science and Technologies of Information - National Research Council), in Pisa. I have a Ph.D. and a Master's Degree in Computer Science.

My main research activity is focused on the use of digital technologies and in particular, 3D computer graphics, in the Cultural Heritage field.
I am an expert in 3D scanning and digitization of real-world objects, especially Cultural Heritage artifacts. I have extensive expertise in data processing and 3D model creation. I have worked a lot on methods for the color capture and photographic mapping onto 3D models.
Currently, I am working on the web-based visualization of 3D models.
I am a developer of MeshLab, and the main architect of 3DHOP.
I have coordinated and carried out various 3D scanning campaigns, both in Italy and abroad.
