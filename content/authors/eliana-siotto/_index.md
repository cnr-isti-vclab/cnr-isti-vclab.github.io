I am a permanent researcher at the Visual Computing Lab ISTI-CNR. I am a researcher in the digital technologies used for documenting, managing, and enhancing Cultural Heritage for conservation work and museum exhibitions. I specialised in studying the ancient colour on the marble surface and using 2D/3D Computer Graphic techniques for the knowledge and the virtual reconstruction of the ancient polychromy. I have multidisciplinary training and I am a pioneer in my field of research. I graduated with honours in Cultural Heritage Preservation (Old Settlement, Restoration Techniques matter), I was a lecturer in the field of Museology applied to Archaeology and I holds a PhD in Classical Archaeology at the University of Pisa. At the same time, I obtained a 2nd level Master degree in Geographic Information Systems, I specialised in 2D/3D Computer Graphic techniques and deepened my studies in the field of diagnostic surveys for Cultural Heritage.
