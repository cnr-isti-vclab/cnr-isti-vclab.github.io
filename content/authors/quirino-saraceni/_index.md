#I am a Research Fellow of the Visual Computing Lab of ISTI-CNR in Pisa.

#My research is focused on Computer Graphics, mainly on Digital Fabrication and Geometry Processing. I am currently mantaining several software developed in the VCLab. The main ones are MeshLab and PyMeshLab.

#Before joining the VCLab, I was part of the CG3HCI group of the University of Cagliari, where I earned my BSc, MSc and Ph.D.
