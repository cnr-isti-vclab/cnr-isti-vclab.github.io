I'm a Researcher at the Visual Computing Lab at CNR-ISTI (National Research Council of Italy, Institute of Information Science and Technologies).
I am involved in developing IT tools using computer vision, geometric processing, and AI for environmental monitoring and cultural heritage investigations.
Since 2021, I have served as a software architect for the interactive annotation software TagLab, widely adopted in coral reef ecology.
