Francesco Banterle is a Researcher at the Visual Computing Laboratory at ISTI-CNR, Italy. He received a Ph.D. in Engineering from Warwick University in 2009. During his Ph.D. he developed Inverse Tone Mapping that bridges the gap between Low Dynamic Range Imaging and High Dynamic Range (HDR) Imaging. He holds two patents, one sold to Dolby, and the other one of these was transferred to goHDR, which he co-founded in 2009.
His main research fields are high dynamic range (HDR) imaging (acquisition, tone mapping, HDR video compression, and HDR monitors), augmented reality on mobile, and rendering (global illumination, and image-based lighting). Recently, he has been working on applying Deep Learning to imaging; i.e., the distillation of perceptual metrics, efficient video structure-from-motion, and relighting of portraits.
