I am a PhD student of the Visual Computing Lab of ISTI-CNR in Pisa.

I graduated from the Master's Degree program in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Pisa. During my master's thesis, i dealt with the generation of artificial mammograms through Image-to-Image Translation techniques. 

My main research activity is focused on the use of NeRFs in the biomedical field.
