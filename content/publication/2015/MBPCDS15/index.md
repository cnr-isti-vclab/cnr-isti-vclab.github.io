 Abstract
 A very large number of sites, probably the
 large majority of our Cultural Heritage (CH), are unaccessible
 to the public due to the lack of infrastructure,
 improper security conditions or lack of personnel. Digitizing
 in 3D those sites is not very complicated nowadays.
 We will briefly review the technology available
 for cheap 3D digitization, from 3D scanning to cheaper
 photogrammetric solutions. However, digitization per
 se is not a solution: 3D models have to be shared in the
 widest and easiest manner. We will present the design
 and results of a software instrument that aims at supporting
 easy navigation of 3D digitized spaces, running
 on top of mobile devices such as tablets or smartphones.
 The main goal of this project is to guarantee navigation
 with ease for users without experience in computer
 graphics and videogames, while providing high-fidelity
 rendering of the digital 3D model.
