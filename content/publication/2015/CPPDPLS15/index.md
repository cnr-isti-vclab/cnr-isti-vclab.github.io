abstract: 'In this work, we will present the outcomes of the 3D diagnostic investigations carried out on the painting Alchemy by Jackson Pollock. Thanks to an accurate digitization and a careful processing, we were able to generate a very precise high-resolution 3D model that proved to be useful in different stages of the diagnostic and conservation campaign. The 3D model was integrated in the conservation process, along with the other diagnostic investigations; the geometric data was also used to produce images and video sequences for dissemination purposes. The most interesting aspect of the work, however, was the idea of going beyond photo-realism and the use of the scanner-measured geometry to try to interpret and understand the traces and signs on the surface of the painting, in relation with the gestures and techniques used by Pollock while painting this masterpiece. Combining the knowledge of the curators and the metric data gathered in the digitization, we were able to discover and validate several interesting aspects of the painting, in the direction of trying to better understanding the painting process which was, in the idea of the artist, an essential part of the artwork. The 3D model of the artwork played a central role also in the temporary exhibition created for the dissemination of the conservation and the diagnostic campaign to the museum visitors. This was also done following the idea of using the geometry to explain the gestures, actions and techniques of Jackson Pollock at work. The 3D model was used to create an interactive kiosk, to have the visitors navigate the model and access explanations of relevant geometrical details and to produce a 1:1 physical reproduction to give the public the possibility to physically interact with the artwork.'
