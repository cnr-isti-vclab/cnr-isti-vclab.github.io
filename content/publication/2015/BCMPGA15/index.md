abstract: 'abstract 	 	 	    Abstract This paper discusses a case study on the use of augmented reality (AR) within the context of cultural heritage. We implemented an iOS app for markerless AR that will be exhibited at the MUST museum in Lecce, Italy. The app shows a rich 3D reconstruction of the Roman amphitheater, which is nowadays only partially visible. The use of state-of-the-art algorithms in computer graphics and computer vision allows the viewing and the exploration of the ancient theater in real-time.            More details please have a look to the official LecceAR webpage.'
