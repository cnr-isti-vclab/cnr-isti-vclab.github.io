abstract: 'High-order and regularly sampled surface representations are more
 efficient and compact than general meshes and considerably simplify
 many geometric modeling and processing algorithms. A number
 of recent algorithms for conversion of arbitrary meshes to regularly
 sampled form (typically quadrangulation) aim to align the resulting
 mesh with feature lines of the geometry. While resulting in a
 substantial improvement in mesh quality, feature alignment makes
 it difficult to obtain coarse regular patch partitions of the mesh.
 In this paper, we propose an approach to constructing patch layouts
 consisting of small numbers of quadrilateral patches while maintaining
 good feature alignment. To achieve this, we use quadrilateral
 T-meshes, for which the intersection of two faces may not be
 the whole edge or vertex, but a part of an edge. T-meshes offer
 more flexibility for reduction of the number of patches and vertices
 in a base domain while maintaining alignment with geometric features.
 At the same time, T-meshes retain many desirable features
 of quadrangulations, allowing construction of high-order representations,
 easy packing of regularly sampled geometric data into textures,
 as well as supporting different types of discretizations for
 physical simulation.
