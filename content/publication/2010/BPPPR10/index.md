abstract: 'We present an improved algorithm for the progressive simplification of quad meshes, which adapts the resolution of the mesh to details of the modeled shape. We extend our previous work, by simplifying the approach and combining it with the concept of Fitmaps. 
 The new algorithm has several advantages: it is simpler and more robust; it does not need a parametrization of the input shape; it is adaptive; and it preserves projectability of the output mesh to the input shape, thus supporting displacement mapping. We present experimental results on a variety of datasets, showing relevant improvement over previous results under several aspects.'
