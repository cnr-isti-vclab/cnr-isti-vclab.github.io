abstract: 'Statics Aware Voronoi Grid-shells have been recently introduced in the Architectural Geometry field. These are innovative grid- shells endowed with a polygonal topology, whose geometry is structurally optimized by means of a novel algorithm. Although being structurally effective and arguably aesthetically charming, so far these grid-shells have struggled to attract architects'' interest. We propose a method to fabricate a mockup of the grid shell by using modern additive 3D printing and laser cutting technologies. We also show how the realised mockup can be used to perform a preliminary validation of the simulated static performances of the grid-shell structure.'
