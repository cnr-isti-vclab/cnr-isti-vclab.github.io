abstract: 'Grid-shells are lightweight structures used to cover long spans with few load-bearing material, as they excel for lightness, elegance and transparency. In this paper we analyse the stability of hex-dominant free-form grid-shells, generated with the Statics Aware Voronoi Remeshing scheme introduced in Pietroni et al. (2015). This is a novel hex-dominant, organic-like and non uniform remeshing pattern that manages to take into account the statics of the underlying surface. We show how this pattern is particularly suitable for free-form grid-shells, providing good performance in terms of both aesthetics and structural behaviour. To reach this goal, we select a set of four con- temporary architectural surfaces and we establish a systematic comparative analysis between Statics Aware Voronoi Grid-Shells and equivalent state of the art triangular and quadrilateral grid-shells. For each dataset and for each grid-shell topology, imperfection sensitivity analyses are carried out and the worst response diagrams compared. It turns out that, in spite of the in- trinsic weakness of the hexagonal topology, free-form Statics Aware Voronoi Grid-Shells are much more effective than their state-of-the-art quadrilateral counterparts.'
