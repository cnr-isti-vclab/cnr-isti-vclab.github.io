abstract: 'Online publishing of almost every type of 3D data has become a quasi-standard routine. Nevertheless, the integration in a 	web page of a single 3D model, or of a predefined restricted set of models, raises different issues compared to an efficient and 	effective integration of thousands of them in an online repository. In this case it is mandatory to have an automatized pipeline to 	prepare and homogenize the dataset. The pipeline should be able to automatically wrap 3D data in all conditions, and display 	every single model with the best scene setup without any (or with a minimal) interaction by the database maintainers. 	This paper, retracing the steps of a recent real application case, aims at showing all the faced issues (and the adopted solutions) 	to publish a large and heterogeneous three-dimensional dataset in a web specialized repository. We want to introduce a valid 	and reusable strategy, starting from the description of the pipeline adopted for data pre-processing and moving to the choices 	made in the 3D viewer implementation. The paper concludes with a discussion on the actual state of the integration of 3D data 	with the other multimedia informative layers.'
