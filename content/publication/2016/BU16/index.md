abstract: 'Abstract Capturing HDR videos is still a challenging task because HDR camera systems are either very costly (commercial systems) or have not matured enough to reach consumer markets (research prototypes). Recently, unofficial firmware for cameras has started to appear, and the firmware allows for reprogramming of the system to capture footage with an extended dynamic range. The dynamic range that can be captured in a single shot, however, is still limited and does not fully cover the dynamic range found in high-contrast scenes. There is, therefore, a need for low-cost techniques that allow for HDR-video capture using off-the-shelf equipment. This chapter describes methods for enhancing the standard dynamic range using previously captured HDR photographs of the same scene.     Link to the official publication.'
