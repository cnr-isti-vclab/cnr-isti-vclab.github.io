 In the last years, the development of compression algorithms for image collections (e.g., photo albums) has become very popular due to the enormous diffusion of digital photographs. Typically, current solutions create an image sequence from images of the photo album to make them suitable for compression using a High Performance Video Coding (HEVC) encoder. In this study, we investigated a different approach to compress a collection of similar images. Our main idea is to exploit the inter- and intra- patch redundancy to compress the entire set of images. In practice, our approach is equivalent to compress the image set with Vector Quantization (VQ) using a global codebook. Our tests show that our clusterization algorithm is effective for a large number of images.
