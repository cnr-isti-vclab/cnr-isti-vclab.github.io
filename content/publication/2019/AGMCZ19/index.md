abstract: 'We propose a fabrication technique for the fast and cheap production of 3D replicas of proteins. We leverage silicone casting
 	with rigid molds, to produce flexible models which can be safely extracted from the mold, and easily manipulated to simulate
 	the biological interaction mechanisms between proteins. We believe that tangible models can be useful in education as well as
 	in laboratory settings, and that they will ease the understanding of fundamental principles of macromolecular organization.'
