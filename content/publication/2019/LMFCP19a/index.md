abstract: 'Shells made of structural glass are charming objects from both the aesthetics and the engineering point of view. However, they pose two signicant challenges: the rst one is to assure adequate safety and redundancy concerning possible global collapse; the second one is to guarantee the economy for replacing collapsed components. To address both requirements, this research explores a novel concept where triangular panels of structural glass are both post-tensioned and reinforced to create 3D free-form systems. Hence, the ligree steel truss, made of edges reinforcements, is sized in performance-based perspective to bear at least the weight of all panels in the occurrence of simultaneous cracks (worst-case scenario). The panels are post-tensioned using a set of edge-aligned cables that add benecial compressive stress on the surface. The cable placement and pre-loads are optimized to minimize the tensile stress acting on the shell and match the manufacturing constraints. These shells optimize material usage by providing not only a transparent and fascinating building separation but also load-bearing capabilities. Visual and structural lightness are improved to grid shell competitors.'
