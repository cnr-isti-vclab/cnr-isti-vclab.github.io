abstract: 'We propose ReviewerNet, an online, interactive visualization system aimed to improve the reviewer selection process in the  	academic domain. Given a paper submitted for publication, we assume that good candidate reviewers can be chosen among  	the authors of a small set of pertinent papers; ReviewerNet supports the construction of such set of papers, by visualizing and  	exploring a literature citation network. Then, the system helps to select reviewers that are both well distributed in the scientific 	community and that do not have any conflict-of-interest, by visualising the careers and co-authorship relations of candidate 	reviewers. The system is publicly available, and is demonstrated in the field of Computer Graphics.'
