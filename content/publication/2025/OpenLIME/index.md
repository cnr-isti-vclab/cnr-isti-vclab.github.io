abstract:  We introduce OpenLIME (Open Layered IMage Explorer), an open, scalable, and flexible framework for creating web-based interactive tools to annotate and inspect large multi-layered and multi-channel standard and relightable image models. Adaptive image management and display use a data-flow approach, where images from sources of any size are efficiently streamed into screen-sized buffers that can be processed and combined using customizable WebGL shaders. The framework natively supports multispectral images, Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), and Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) datasets and can be extended to accommodate other multi-channel raster datasets, such as neural representations. Multi-layer and multi-faceted visualizations are achieved through opacity adjustments, blending modes, and interactive lenses. The released library provides a set of pre-configured layers, facilitating the rapid deployment of web-based datasets and kiosk applications. Its responsive user interface is compatible with desktop, mobile, and general multitouch environments, while its modular architecture allows for extensive customization, making it adaptable to diverse annotation and visualization needs. The paper illustrates the framework's design and discusses specific use cases, including the inspection of RTI models, the integration of novel relightable image formats, archaeological data documentation and annotation, and standalone museum application creation and deployment. The main components of the framework are released as open source.
