The book provides detailed equations and Matlab code. This allows the reader to have the tools for experimenting with HDR Imaging for producing compelling images.   The book is divided in the following chapters:  	Introduction (a brief introduction on light, human vision, 	and color spaces) 	HDR Pipeline (including capturing, storing formats, and HDR 	monitors) 	Tone Mapping 	Expansion Operators for Low Dynamic Range Content 	(Inverse/Reverse Tone Mapping) 	Image-Based Lighting 	Evaluation of Tone Mapping and Expansion Operators 	HDR Content Compressiong (images, textures, and videos)   The book provides three appendecies on the Bilateral Filter, Retinex Filters, and how to use the HDR Toolbox for Matlab.'
