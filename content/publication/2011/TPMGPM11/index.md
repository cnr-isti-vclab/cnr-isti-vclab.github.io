abstract: 'In the recent decades robotics and computer science have been  gaining more and more relevance in all aspects of our lives. In surgery, for  example, they gave birth to procedures, impossible to perform otherwise, like  the tele-surgery or the nano-surgery. On this regard, these applied sciences  already play an important role in assisting the surgeon both in the operative  room and, as a support, in the education of young surgeons, but much work has  still to be done.  In fact in these last years we have seen an extreme change in the traditional  training in surgery and the computer-based simulation is one of the main reason  of this shift. The spread of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) has brought  major improvements in the quality of healthcare, but it has also increased the  complexity of the surgical procedures requiring advanced and highly  specialized training systems. Moreover these training procedures need to be  reiterated during the operational life of surgeons. Therefore, considering the  limited availability of cadavers and the public concern with the non-ethical  treatment of animals, the traditional approaches to surgical training are  drastically limited encouraging the use of surgical simulators based on virtual  environments.  Healthcare industries and the scientific community in medicine agree  indicating the disruptive potential of the application of Virtual Reality (VR) to  the training in the medical field. Therefore the next step is the development of  surgical simulators with an high level of realism in order to practice complex  procedures in a safe environment. Moreover it is decisive that this evolution is  done integrating advanced medical imaging and processing, allowing surgeons  to practice simulated interventions on patient specific dataset.  The increasing importance of MIS techniques will cause a drastic change in  pre-operation planning and basic surgical training. In fact, the features of this  kind of surgical approach (the workspace limitation, the 2D vision through a  laparoscopic camera and the indirect physical interaction with the patient body)  make it possible to use a surgical simulator to train, plan or simulate an  intervention, reproducing the visual and tactile feedback of the real surgical  procedure on a real patient.  This paper presents some research and applicative results on Computer  Assisted Surgery (CAS) achieved in the framework of EndoCAS, a newly  founded Center of Excellence in Pisa. The research has involved: the  development of segmentation algorithms for volumetric datasets, the simulation  of bone drilling procedures, the modeling of deformable object cuts and  deformations and the simulation of rope interactions during a suture procedure  in MIS. All these projects were been developed using a new open source library  to support the implementation of techniques for simulating deformable objects.  Our purpose is to enhance the surgical training with new improved  techniques applied both to the medical imaging and to the computer-based  simulation in order to carry the surgical training to a next level of realism.'
