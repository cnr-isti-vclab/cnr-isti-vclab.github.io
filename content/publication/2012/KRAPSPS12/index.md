abstract: 'This paper presents three different propositions for cultural heritage organisations on how to digitise objects in 3D. It is based on the practical evaluation of three different deployment experiments that use different methods and business models for mass 3D-acquisition. These models are: developing the skills of in-house staff within an organisation, the use of external professionals and using crowdsourcing as a mechanism for developing the 3D collection. Furthermore, the paper provides an analysis of these models, lessons learned and practical recommendations for cultural heritage organisations. The analysis includes considerations of issues such as strategy, size of the organisation, skills, equipment, object accessibility and complexity as well as the cost, time and quality of the 3D technology. The paper concludes that most organisations are able to develop 3D collections but variations in the result will be reflected by the strategic approach they place on innovative 3D technologies.'
