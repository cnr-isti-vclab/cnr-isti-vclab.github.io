abstract: 'abstract 	 	 	    Source code and binaries soon!  Abstract In this paper, we present BoostHDR, a novel method for compressing high dynamic range (HDR) images. The algorithm leverages on a novel segmentation-based tone mapping operator (TMO) which relaxes the no seams constraint. Our method can work with both JPEG and JPEG2000 encoders. Moreover, it provides better results compared to the state of the art in HDR images compression algorithms in terms of bit per pixels (bpp), and visual quality using objective metrics. Keywords: HDR Imaging, HDR Image Compression'
