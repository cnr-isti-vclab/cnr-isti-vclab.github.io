abstract: 'We present a system to provide an enhanced access of ordinary people to a collection of ancient coins, preserved in the National Museum of San Matteo in Pisa (Italy). Those coins have been digitized to produce RTI representations and are presented to museum visitors together with data telling their story. The interactive presentation system, designed to be deployed either by a museum kiosk or by a web site, is composed of two integrated sections: a brief introduction to the different subsets of coins; an interactive RTI viewer. The coins are organized in different subsets to better present them to a public of inexperienced visitors. The viewer supports the interaction with the RTI image through a set of functionalities: changing the light direction; zooming; panning over the image; flipping the coin; visualizing hot spots, which link specific areas on the coin with descriptive HTML hypertext.'
