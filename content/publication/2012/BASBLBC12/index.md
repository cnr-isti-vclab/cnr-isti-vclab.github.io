 Abstract
 In this paper we present a new technique for the display of High
 Dynamic Range (HDR) images on Low Dynamic Range (LDR)
 displays. The described process has three stages. First, the input
 image is segmented into luminance zones. Second, the tone mapping
 operator (TMO) that performs better in each zone is automatically
 selected. Finally, the resulting tone mapping (TM) outputs
 for each zone are merged, generating the final LDR output image.
 To establish the TMO that performs better in each luminance zone
 we conducted a preliminary psychophysical experiment using a set
 of HDR images and six different TMOs. We validated our composite
 technique on several (new) HDR images and conducted a
 further psychophysical experiment, using an HDR display as reference,
 that establishes the advantages of our hybrid three-stage approach
 over a traditional individual TMO.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Schematic description of our Framework. First, the HDR
 input image is segmented into luminance zones and a zone map is
 created. Second, the optimal TMO for each zone is applied on the
 whole input image generating different output images (one for each
 zone). Finally the tone mapped images are merged and the final
 output is generated. (For visualization purposes we only show the
 specific zone tone mapped in the Tone Mapped Zones image on the
 right.)'
