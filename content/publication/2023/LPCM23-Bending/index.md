abstract: 'We introduce a new method for designing reinforcement for grid shells and improving their resistance to out-of-plane forces inducing bending. The central concept is to support the base network of elements with an additional layer of beams placed at a certain distance from the base surface. We exploit two main techniques to design these structures: first, we derive the orientation of the beam network on a given initial surface forming the grid shell to be reinforced; then, we compute the height of the additional layer that maximizes its overall structural performance. Our method includes a new formulation to derive a smooth direction field that orients the quad remeshing and a novel algorithm that iteratively optimizes the height of the additional layer to minimize the structureâ€™s compliance. We couple our optimization strategy with a set of constraints to improve buildability of the network and, simultaneously, preserve the initial surface. We showcase our method on a significant dataset of shapes to demonstrate its applicability to cases where free-form grid shells do not exhibit adequate structural performance due to their geometry.'
