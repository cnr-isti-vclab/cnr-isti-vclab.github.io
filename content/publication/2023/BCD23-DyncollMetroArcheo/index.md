abstract: This contribution will present the latest results of the Dynamic Collections project, highlighting the evolution of the approach, methodologies and tools. The core idea behind the project was to explore the possibilities of working online, for teaching and study purposes, with high-resolution digital replicas of archaeological artefacts, going beyond the single-object approach. To this aim, the project built an archive of high-resolution digital models, and designed and implemented an online platform that makes it possible to build, annotate and share a custom assemblage of the objects in the archive (a Dynamic Collection, that is). These annotated collections can be the pivot element in the definition of collaborative workflows and shared research/teaching environments.
