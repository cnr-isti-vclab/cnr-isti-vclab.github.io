abstract: 'FreeGrid is meant to offer a common benchmark to test and compare different approaches to the design
and optimization of steel gridshells, from man-based heuristic design to AI-based one. FreeGrid sets
three design baseline problems: a barrel vault, a paraboloidal dome, and a hyperbolic paraboloid, having
their spring line partially not constrained (free-edge) and subjected to symmetric and asymmetric load
conditions. Participants are called to modify the baseline gridshell(s) in order to improve their structural
performances, buildability, and sustainability, all three of them weighted in a single, bulk quantitative
performance metric. Participants shall comply with a limited number of design constraints, while any
other design solution is allowed. Baseline setups, performance metrics and design constraints will be
fully detailed in technical specifications made publicly available. The full data of the baseline structures
will be offered to participants according to an Open Data policy, together with postprocessing utilities
intended to align the procedure to obtain the performance metrics. The FreeGrid benchmark will be
launched within the IASS Symposium 2023 in Melbourne.'
