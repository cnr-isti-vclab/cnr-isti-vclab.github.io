abstract: 'In this paper, we present a physically based model for real-time 
 simulation of thread dynamics. Our model captures all the relevant 
 aspects of the physics of the thread, including quasi-zero elasticity, 
 bending, torsion and self-collision, and it provides output forces 
 for the haptic feedback. The physical properties are modeled in 
 terms of constraints that are iteratively satis√ûed while the numerical 
 integration is carried out through a Verlet scheme. This approach 
 leads to an unconditionally stable, controllable and computationally 
 light simulation. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, showing the interaction of the thread with other objects in real time and the creation of complex knots.'
