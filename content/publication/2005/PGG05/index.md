abstract: 'Computer assisted medical applications require often the reconstruction of anatomical structures to compute
 parametershttps://vcgdata.isti.cnr.itor interventional planning. From CT and MRI datasets it is possible to obtain surface
 models of the organs of interest with a variety of algorithms, like Marching Cubes, level sets or deformable
 parametric surfaces. Each technique has advantages but also drawbacks like noise sensitivity (isosurface extraction),
 risk of leakages (level sets), oversmoothing and impossible handling of topological changes (Deformable
 models). To obtain a good trade-off between robustness, shape constraints and topological control, we propose
 a 3D balloon/isosurface method joining the advantages in curvature control, leakage penalization and efficiency
 of parametric surfaces with a fast re-parametrization handling topological changes. It is based on the control of
 surface self-intersections, freezing of the intersected nodes and replacement of the final mesh with an isosurface
 computed on a field representing the signed distance from the true surface.'
