abstract: 'We introduce a new texture representation that combines standard
 bi-lineahttps://vcgdata.isti.cnr.ites, for smoothly varying regions, with customizable discontinuities for sharp boundaries
 between these regions. It consists in a standard signal texture, plus a second texture we call pinchmap, which
 encodes discontinuities along generally curved lines; this structure is stored in texture memory as a pair of
 images and is effciently interpreted on commodity graphic hardware in the fragment shader. We also present a fully
 automatic way to compute a pinchmap and signal texture pair from an much higher resolution image. We show
 that the final effect on the screen is a comparable visual quality, for a fraction of the texture storage cost
 and a very small impact on performance.'
