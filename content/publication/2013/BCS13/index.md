 AbstractIn this paper, we present a novel parallel implementation of a high fidelity inverse tone mapping operator. Our
 method makes use of point based graphics to accelerate density estimation, and multi-core CPUs for extracting
 light sources. We show that our method can achieve real-time performance on a lower-end graphics card, with
 minimum loss of quality.'
