 AbstractHigh dynamic range images require tone reproduction to match the range of values to the capabilities of the display. For computational reasons as well as absence of fully calibrated imagery, rudimentary color reproduction is often added as a post-processing step rather than integrated into the tone reproduction algorithm. However, in the general case this currently requires manual parameter tuning, although for some global tone reproduction operators, parameter settings can be inferred from the tone curve. We present a novel and fully automatic saturation correction technique, suitable for any tone reproduction operator, which exhibits better color reproduction than the state-of-the-art and we validate its comparative effectiveness through psychophysical experimentation.'
