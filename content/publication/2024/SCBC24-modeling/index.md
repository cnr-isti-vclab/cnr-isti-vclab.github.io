abstract: 'Structure from Motion (SfM) is a computer vision technique used to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) structures from a series of two-dimensional (2D) images or video frames. However, SfM tools struggle with transparent objects, reflective surfaces, and low-resolution frames. In such situations, image-based interactive 3D modeling software packages are employed to model 3D objects and measure dimensions. Our contributions to this work are twofold. First, we have introduced new tools to improve 3D modeling software packages; such tools are aimed at easing the workload for users. Second, we have conducted a comprehensive user study to evaluate the efficacy of popular 3d modeling software packages. The task is to measure certain dimensions for which ground truth measurements are already known. A relative error is calculated for every measurement. The evaluation of each software tool is done through survey form, event logs, and measurement relative error. The results of this user study clearly show that our approach to 3D modeling using multiple images has a lower relative error and produces higher quality 3D models than other software packages. In addition, it shows our new tools reduce the required time for completing a task.'
