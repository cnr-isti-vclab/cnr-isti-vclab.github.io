abstract:  The digital technologies employed in archaeology since the 1990s have progressively and experimentally been utilized over the last two decades to document and re-present the ancient polychromy of Greek and Roman marble artworks. Given that this remains a developing field of investigation and application, this study offers, for the first time, a systematic review of the endeavours undertaken thus far in implementing information technology for the documentation, analysis, reconstruction, visualization, and presentation of ancient polychromy. This overview is supported by a literature review and existing implementations, organized into methods and techniques employed for 3D colour preservation, analysis, and reconstruction, as well as those used for the visualization and dissemination of findings. The goal is to identify gaps and provide intriguing insights for future research concerning the use of digital technologies as an essential tool in the stages of documenting and disseminating ancient polychromy in architecture and archaeological artefacts. This, in turn, aims to encourage data sharing, contribute to the dissemination of science-based knowledge and resolve substantial barriers associated with the long-term retention of digital data.
