 Abstract
 We describe an automated pipeline for digitization of catolog drawings of pottery types. This work is aimed at extracting a structured description of the main geometric features and a 3D representation of each class. The pipeline includes methods for understanding a 2D drawing and using it for constructing a 3D model of the pottery. These will be used to populate a reference database for classification of potsherds. Furthermore, we extend the pipeline with methods for breaking the 3D model to obtain synthetic sherds and methods for capturing images of these sherds in a way that matches the imaging methodology of archaeologists. These will serve to build a massive set of synthetic sherd images that will help train and test future automated classification systems.
