 Table of Contents
 This book is a practical introduction to the field of
 High Dynamic Range imaging that combines photography, computer
 vision, and computer graphics. The second edition focuses on
 HDR video content that is increasing its importance given the
 introduction in the market of affordable HDR televisions. Furthermore,
 we have revised and expanded previous content.
 
 As in the first edition, the book provides detailed equations
 and Matlab code. This allows the reader to have the tools for
 experimenting with HDR Imaging for producing compelling images.
 
 
 
 The book is divided in the following chapters:
 
 	Introduction (a brief introduction on light, human vision,
         and color spaces);
     
     HDR Content Generation;
 
     Tone Mapping;
     
     New Trend in Tone Mapping;
 
     HDR Video Tone Mapping;
 
     Expansion Operators for Low Dynamic Range Content;
 
     Image-Based Lighting;
 
     HDR Image Compression;
 
     HDR Video Compression;
     
     Evaluation.
     
 
 
 The book provides three appendecies on the bilateral filter, color spaces, and how to use the HDR Toolbox for Matlab.'
