abstract: 3D digital models are unanimously considered an invaluable asset in the study, management and promotion of Cultural Heritage. COVID-19 emergency has accelerated the common trend of working remotely, and, for Cultural Heritage, presenting, sharing, and accessing 3D data online is now perceived as a necessity. Unfortunately, the lack of standard methodologies, tools, and infrastructures, makes it difficult to jump from local storage to web management of complex 3D data. In this contribution, we want to assess the state-of-the-art of advanced use of 3D on the web, highlighting the current needs, presenting some case studies, and exploring the future perspectives.
