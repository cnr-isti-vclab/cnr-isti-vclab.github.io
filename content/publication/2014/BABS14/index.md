 AbstractPhysically based renderers produce high quality images with
 high dynamic range (HDR) values. Therefore, these images
 need to be tone mapped in order to be displayed on low dynamic
 range (LDR) displays. A typical approach is to blindly
 apply tone mapping operators without taking advantage of the
 extra information that comes for free from the modeling process
 for creating a 3D scene. In this paper, we propose a novel
 pipeline for tone mapping high dynamic range (HDR) images
 which are generated using physically based renderers. Our
 work exploits information of a 3D scene, such as geometry,
 materials, luminaries, etc. This allows to limit the assumptions
 that are typically made during the tone mapping step.
 As consequence of this, we will show improvements in term
 of quality while keeping the entire process straightforward.'
