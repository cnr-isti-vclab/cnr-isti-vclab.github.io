abstract: 'We propose ReviewerNet, an online, interactive visualization system aimed to improve the reviewer selection process in the academic domain. Given a paper submitted for publication, we assume that good candidate reviewers can be chosen among the authors of a small set of pertinent papers; ReviewerNet supports the construction of such set of papers, by visualizing and exploring a literature citation network. The system helps journal editors and Program Committee members to select reviewers that do not have any conflict-of-interest and are representative of different research groups, by visualising the careers and co-authorship relations of candidate reviewers. The system is publicly available, and is demonstrated in the field of Computer Graphics.  The system is online at Reviewernet.org'
