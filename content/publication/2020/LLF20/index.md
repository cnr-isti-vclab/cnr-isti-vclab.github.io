abstract: 'Glass exhibits brittle failure behavior. Therefore, redundancy is a fundamental design requirement when using  glass as a main structural material. On this basis, a novel structural concept has been developed for hybrid glass-steel  posttensioned triangulated structures, where the two materials collaborate. In forming such lattice structure, local fracture  must be avoided. This paper presents a parametric study that highlights the influences of mechanical and geometrical parameters  on the in-plane and out-of-plane static behaviour of laminated triangular glass panels. The resulting data set constitutes a  useful source for the designer to select the most appropriate component. The main sensitivity parameters are panel length,  laminate thickness, and interlayer stiffness.'
