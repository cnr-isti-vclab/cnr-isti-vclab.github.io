The history of the Visual Computing Lab of CNR-ISTI began more than 25 years ago, with the friendship and collaboration of Claudio Montani (first head of the lab and former CNR-ISTI Director) and Roberto Scopigno (former head of the VClab, now CNR-ISTI Director). [Paolo Cignoni]({{< relref "/authors/paolo-cignoni" >}}), joined the laboratory at its beginning, and now heads the laboratory.
