We have had two papers at SIGGRAPH 2024. The [first paper](https://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2024/BMBK24-SelfSupervisedHDR/) proposes a self-supervised approach to generate an HDR video from a single SDR video with the same quality or better than other state-of-the-art methods. The [second paper](https://vcg.isti.cnr.it/publication/2024/PPSC24-3dTouch/) introduces the first method that extends capacitive touch sensor on a general 3D surface to obtain high-resolution multi-touch detection with high SNR and a spatial accuracy of about 1mm. The paper was selection for the [Best Paper Honorable Mention](https://blog.siggraph.org/2024/06/siggraph-2024-technical-papers-awards-best-papers-honorable-mentions-and-test-of-time.html/). Only 5 best paper and 12 honarable mentions are given out, from a pool of about 840 submissions.
