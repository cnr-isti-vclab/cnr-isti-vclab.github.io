We have recently scanned the Capsella Samagher, a small but incredibly precious artwork conserved at the National Archaeological Museum in Venice. It is a small devotional ivory casket, with carved faces depicting scenes from early Christianity (an early representation of St. Peter Basilica in Rome). This scanning is part of a restoration and musealization project.
