title: "TagLab"
subtitle: "An AI-powered solution for the fast annotation and analysis of orthomosaics"
summary: "TagLab is an AI-powered segmentation software designed to support the analysis of large orthographic images generated through the photogrammetric pipeline.
TagLab has a semi-automatic annotation modality, integrating interactive pixel-wise region segmentation models, and a fully automatic learning pipeline that assists the 
users in developing automatic semantic segmentation models. The main objective is to speed up, through intelligent tools, the extraction of measures from scientific 
image data containing complex shapes. These tools augment human abilities maintaining the centrality of human expertise."
