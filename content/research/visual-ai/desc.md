Visual AI is the field of artificial intelligence that enables machines to make sense of and act on visual data. At VCLab, the research in Visual AI encompasses different formats of visual data: from images and videos to RTI and 3D surfaces.
 
Visual AI is becoming increasingly important across various applications. At VCLab, the application fields include 3D object design, architectural geometry, environmental monitoring, 3D acquisition and reconstruction, Extended Reality.

Our results in Visual AI contributed to several research projects, including the Horizon 2020 project [SUN - Social and hUman ceNtered XR](https://www.sun-xr-project.eu/), and the EU funded PNRR project [FAIR - Future Artificial Intelligence Research](https://fondazione-fair.it/en/).
