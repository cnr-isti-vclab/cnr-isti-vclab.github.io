At the Visual Computing Lab we study new methods in Visual AI, the discipline that teaches machines to make sense of and act on visual data. Our research in Visual AI encompasses different formats – from images and videos to RTI and 3D surfaces – and applications – from AI-assisted 3D object design and architectural geometry to environmental monitoring, from 3D acquisition and reconstruction to Virtual and Augmented Reality.
