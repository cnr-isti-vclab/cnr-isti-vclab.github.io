This research track is focused on the use of Computer Graphics in the Cultural Heritage field. Our work is aimed at supporting the study, documentation, management, restoration, and promotion of works of art.

We have participated to numerous digitization and survey campaigns in museums, archeological excavations and heritage sites both in Italy and Europe. Our activities have contributed in important conservation-restoration initiatives.
The activities of this track have been part of various research project at EU and national level, such as: ViHAP3D, EPOCH, 3D-COFORM, 3DICONS, ARIADNE / ARIADNE+, ARCHAIDE.

The Visual Computing Lab develops and maintains open source software tools widely used in the CH community: MeshLab, 3DHOP, and, lately, TagLab.
