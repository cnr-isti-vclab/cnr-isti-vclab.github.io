The research pursued in this field investigates novel methods and algorithms for two primary goals. We research solutions to enhance the capabilities of existing digital fabrication devices, such as 3D printers and CNCs. Additionally, the research is focused on developing new fabrication processes or improving the existing ones, exploiting the potential of computational design and digital manufacturing devices.
