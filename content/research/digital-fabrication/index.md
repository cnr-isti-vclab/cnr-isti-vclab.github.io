VC Lab has a strong tradition in the context of 3D Scanning. This was exploited both in creating tools for data processing and visualization of data, and in practical experience in the context of important acquisition campaigns and several pioneering international projects. Activity on 3D acquisition started at VC Lab on mid '90s; we have designed a low-cost 3D scanner and proposed many new algorithms for processing sampled 3D data.
