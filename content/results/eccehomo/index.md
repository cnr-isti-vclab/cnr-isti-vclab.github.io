title: "The ECCEHOMO project"
summary: "_[2018-2019] 3D Digitalisation for Data Integration_<p class=\"summary\">The VC Lab participated at the diagnostic activity of the 'Ecce Homo' by Antonello da Messina within the IperionCH.it - E-RISH.it project. A complete 3D digitization of the artwork was performed to sample morphology of the pictorial surface at very high-resolution and to support further cross-correlation and analysis of the other data sampled. All the scientific data obtained are being integrated by mapping all the data on the 3D/2D space of the digital representation of the artwork. The aim is to make it easy to consult and view all the data on the Web through an Interactive System, both for scientific and dissemination purposes.</p>"
