We created a high-res 3D of the geometry of the painting, usable as metric and scientific documentation, to measure, study and analyze the materic structure of the painting. The 3D models results have then been used to create an interactive kiosk and a physical reproduction of the painting for the exposition 'ALCHEMY BY JACKSON POLLOCK.
