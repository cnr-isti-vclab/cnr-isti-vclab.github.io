summary: "[2016] The Information System of the Restoration <p onclick='this.style.display=\"block\"; event.preventDefault();' style='overflow: hidden; display: -webkit-box; -webkit-line-clamp: 3; -webkit-box-orient: vertical;'>The Visual Computing Lab has developed, in collaboration with the Università di Bologna and the Comune di bologna, the Information System for the restoration of the Neptune Fountain, carried out by the Istituto Superiore per il Restauro e la Conservazione – MIBACT. The system heavily uses the high-resolution 3D models of the fountain, as all the annotation, analyses and observations are mapped on the 3D surface of the structure. The system is completely online, and the restorers can access and work on the 3D models directly from the field.</p>"
