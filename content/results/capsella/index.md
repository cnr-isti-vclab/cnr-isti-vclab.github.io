summary: "[2012-2013] (Museo Archeologico di Venezia)<br/>Digitization and restoration aid <p onclick='this.style.display=\"block\"; event.preventDefault();' style='overflow: hidden; display: -webkit-box; -webkit-line-clamp: 3; -webkit-box-orient: vertical;'>The goal of this project was the digitization (2D and 3D) of the Capsella Samagher, an early-Christian reliquary in the National Archaeology Museum of Venice. The digitization was a prerequisite for a diagnostic activity and a new initial conservative restoration. This Reliquary (height 18,5 cm, length 20,5 cm, width 16,01), which was discovered in Samagher (Pula, Croatia) in 1906 under the altar of the Church of St. Hermagoras, is in carved ivory with corner reinforcements and silver accessories. Probably of Roman craftsmanship, it is of exceptional value for the history of early Christian art. Funded by Gruppo INTESA SANPAOLO.</p>"
