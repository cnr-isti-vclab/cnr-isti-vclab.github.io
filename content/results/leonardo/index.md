title: "The 'Adoration of the Magi' by Leonardo"
summary: "_[2018] 3D Model for Diagnostic and Monitoring_<p class=\"summary\">The VC Lab participated at the diagnostic activity of the 'Adoration of the Magi' by Leonardo da Vinci, providing technical support to the Opificio delle Pietre Dure in Florence. The total surface of the famous unfinished artwork by Leonardo was acquired producing a single high-resolution 3D model. It was used to evaluate the conservation status of the painting and to measure the deformations of the ten wooden support. Furthermore, a previous 3D model created in 2002 was also integrated in the study developing a new approach to quantify the panel deformation along time by comparing the two 3D models. These results were presented for the first time at the International Art and Restoration Fair 2018 in Florence.</p>"
