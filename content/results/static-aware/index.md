title: "Statics Aware Grid Shells"
summary: "_[2015] Polygonal architectural meshes with a stress-field-driven optimizations_<p class=\"summary\">This research proposes a framework for designing grid shells with an optimized polygonal tessellation. In contrast to most of the methods in this field that provide for shape alterations while preserving the mesh topology, this method preserves the initial continuous shape as a given input by the designer and alters the tessellation to improve the statics of the structure.</p>"
