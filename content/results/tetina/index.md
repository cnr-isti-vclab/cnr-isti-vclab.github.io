title: "Etruscan tomb of Sigliano"
summary: "[2011-2013] 3D scanning of the remains of an etruscan tomb and the making of a video <p onclick='this.style.display=\"block\"; event.preventDefault();' style='overflow: hidden; display: -webkit-box; -webkit-line-clamp: 3; -webkit-box-orient: vertical;'>The project, a collaboration between the Visual Computing Lab and the National Archaeological Museum of Umbria (Perugia), has been focused on an Etruscan burial site of Hellenistic age, discovered at the end of the XIX century in Sigliano-Val di Fosso (Perugia), and later destroyed. Its memory survives only in two archival documents and in some artefacts conserved at the National Archaeological Museum of Umbria. The fragmentation and heterogeneity of the materials, however, makes really difficult to provide a 'global' view over this burial site. Thus, we exploited the opportunities offered by digital media, to present to the public the monument as a whole, bringing back its original structures and objects.</p>"
