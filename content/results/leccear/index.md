summary: "_[2014-15] Augmented reality on mobile_<p class=\"summary\">LecceAR is an augmented reality app for iOS 8. This allows adding to a real-world scene, seen from a mobile device's camera, with 3D models of cultural heritage sites as they looked in the past. 3D models are displayed when the user points the device's camera towards a planar target which can be a photograph or an image. The rendered 3D model is anchored to this target in a coherent and smooth way according to user's movements. Funded by PON 'DICET', Regione Puglia, Italia</p>"
