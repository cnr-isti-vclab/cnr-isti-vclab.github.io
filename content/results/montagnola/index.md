title: "La Tomba della Montagnola"
summary: "_[2018-2019] A virtual tour for exploring a hidden structure_<p class=\"summary\">The Montagnola Tomb, in Sesto Fiorentino, is one of the most relevant funerary monument in the northern part of the Etruria region, but is only partially accessible. The VC Lab developed an interactive, web-based kiosk for a virtual visit of the structure. The interactive system allows the user to experience the monument from two points of view: from outside, to appreciate the structure of the mound and of the architectural elements; and from inside, to explore in first person the inner burial chambers. The web-based kiosk uses high-resolution 3D models to give a detailed representation of the monument, enriched by annotations and hot-spots.</p>"
