title: "Position-based tensegrity design"
summary: "_[2017] Automatic generation of stiff tensegrity structures_<p class=\"summary\">This work addresses the design of tensegrity structures, which are lightweight load-bearing assemblies entirely composed by only two types of elements: struts and cables. The form-finding of these structures is well known to be a complex problem, so that most of the existing design methods are based on the repetition of templated modules and are limited to simple shapes. Conversely, the present method creates free-form stable tensegrity configurations that satisfy both fabrication and geometric constraints.</p>"
