title: "Position-based tensegrity design"
summary: "[2017] Automatic generation of stiff tensegrity structures <p onclick='this.style.display=\"block\"; event.preventDefault();' style='overflow: hidden; display: -webkit-box; -webkit-line-clamp: 3; -webkit-box-orient: vertical;'>This work addresses the design of tensegrity structures, which are lightweight load-bearing assemblies entirely composed by only two types of elements: struts and cables. The form-finding of these structures is well known to be a complex problem, so that most of the existing design methods are based on the repetition of templated modules and are limited to simple shapes. Conversely, the present method creates free-form stable tensegrity configurations that satisfy both fabrication and geometric constraints.</p>"
