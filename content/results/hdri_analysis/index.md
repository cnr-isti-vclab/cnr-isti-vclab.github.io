summary: "_[2014-2016] A Focus on Inverse Tone Mapping Content_<p class=\"summary\">Since 2014, the Visual Computing Lab has investigated with the CNRS (Paris, France) the quality and detectability of Low Dynamic Range (LDR) or Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) content after being expaded using Inverse Tone Mapping Operators (ITMOs). This work highlights limitations of content expansion and how to detect it.</p>"
