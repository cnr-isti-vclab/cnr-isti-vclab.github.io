abstract: 'abstract 	 	 	     AbstractPhoto-realistic rendering of virtual objects into real scenes is one of the most important research problems in computer graphics.      Methods for capture and rendering of mixed reality scenes are driven by a large number of applications, ranging from augmented reality to visual      effects and product visualization. Recent developments in computer graphics, computer vision, and imaging technology have enabled a wide range of      new mixed reality techniques including methods of advanced image based lighting, capturing spatially varying lighting conditions, and algorithms for      seamlessly rendering virtual objects directly into photographs without explicit measurements of the scene lighting. This report gives an overview of      the state-of-the-art in this field, and presents a categorization and comparison of current methods. Our in-depth survey provides a tool for understanding      the advantages and disadvantages of each method, and gives an overview of which technique is best suited to a specific problem.'
