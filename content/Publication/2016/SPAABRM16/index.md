abstract: 'Abstract An integrated gamut- and tone-management framework for color-accurate reproduction of high dynamic range images can prevent hue and luminance shifts while taking gamut boundaries into consideration. The proposed approach is conceptually and computationally simple, parameter-free, and compatible with existing tone-mapping operators.     Link to the official publication.'
