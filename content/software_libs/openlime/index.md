title: "OpenLIME"
summary: "OpenLIME (Open Layered IMage Explorer) is an open-source JavaScript library for the efficient display of scalable high-resolution relightable images.<br/>
It natively supports BRDF and RTI datasets, and can be easily extended for other multi-channel raster datasets, such as hyper spectral imaging or other reflectance modeling. Input data can be combined in a multi-layer visualization system using opacity and blending modes, and interactive lenses.
OpenLIME is jointly developed by CRS4 Visual and Data-intensive Computing Group.<br/>"
