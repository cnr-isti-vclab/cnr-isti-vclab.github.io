The system is the response of the two Institutions to making this artistic masterpiece available during Covid-19. The system allows access to the ‘digital Loggia’ and permits the visitor to navigate freely through the high-resolution panoramic image of the painted ceiling, admire it from a closer point of view, and consult the historical, botanical and zoological researches, and the result of the scientific analyses performed. The system is available online and with an interactive kiosk in the Farnesina building.&lt;/p>

We created a high-res 3D of the geometry of the painting, usable as metric and scientific documentation, to measure, study and analyze the materic structure of the painting. The 3D models results have then been used to create an interactive kiosk and a physical reproduction of the painting for the exposition 'ALCHEMY BY JACKSON POLLOCK. Discovering the Artist at Work' (Peggy Guggenheim collection, Venice).&lt;/p>

The digitization was a prerequisite for a diagnostic activity and a new initial conservative restoration. This Reliquary (height 18,5 cm, length 20,5 cm, width 16,01), which was discovered in Samagher (Pula, Croatia) in 1906 under the altar of the Church of St. Hermagoras, is in carved ivory with corner reinforcements and silver accessories. Probably of Roman craftsmanship, it is of exceptional value for the history of early Christian art. Funded by Gruppo INTESA SANPAOLO.&lt;/p>

Its memory survives only in two archival documents and in some artefacts conserved at the National Archaeological Museum of Umbria. The fragmentation and heterogeneity of the materials, however, makes really difficult to provide a 'global' view over this burial site. Thus, we exploited the opportunities offered by digital media, to present to the public the monument as a whole, bringing back its original structures and objects.&lt;/p>

This pattern aims at controlling the flexibility of each panel so that, once all pieces are individually bent and assembled, the structure reaches the designed target shape.&lt;/p>

The FlexMaps 2.0 is a wooden structure, whose shape has been selected among a set of possible shapes to challenge the realization of a complex topology within a restricted indoor space. The selected anticlastic design geometry is a non-developable vaulted surface with three outer arch profiles and a central hole. The structure exploits the strengths of the FlexMaps systems of using mesostructured spiral geometry. Thus, it is possilbe to produce bespoke panels with variable stiffness by only modifying the geometrical parameters of the spiral without changing the material.&lt;/p>

The VC Lab developed an interactive, web-based kiosk for a virtual visit of the structure. The interactive system allows the user to experience the monument from two points of view: from outside, to appreciate the structure of the mound and of the architectural elements; and from inside, to explore in first person the inner burial chambers. The web-based kiosk uses high-resolution 3D models to give a detailed representation of the monument, enriched by annotations and hot-spots.&lt;/p>

This allows adding to a real-world scene, seen from a mobile device's camera, with 3D models of cultural heritage sites as they looked in the past. 3D models are displayed when the user points the device's camera towards a planar target which can be a photograph or an image. The rendered 3D model is anchored to this target in a coherent and smooth way according to user's movements. Funded by PON 'DICET', Regione Puglia, Italia&lt;/p>

Probably produced within the Islamic Mediterranean in the eleventh century, the Griffin was brought to Pisa after raids in Majorca. For centuries it was a guardian figure on top of the roof of Pisa Cathedral. The present project is focused on the Griffin but also includes alongside it other bronze animal sculptures such as the Mari-Cha Lion and the Lucca Falcon. Funded by Opera Primaziale Pisana.&lt;/p>

The form-finding of these structures is well known to be a complex problem, so that most of the existing design methods are based on the repetition of templated modules and are limited to simple shapes. Conversely, the present method creates free-form stable tensegrity configurations that satisfy both fabrication and geometric constraints.&lt;/p>

The kiosk is easy and intuitive to use for the ordinary public of the museum and it allows the real-time manipulation of RTI (Reflectance Transformation Imaging) of each coin face with a set of basic operations like zooming, panning, flipping the coin, changing of the light direction.&lt;/p>

In contrast to most of the methods in this field that provide for shape alterations while preserving the mesh topology, this method preserves the initial continuous shape as a given input by the designer and alters the tessellation to improve the statics of the structure.&lt;/p>

The total surface of the famous unfinished artwork by Leonardo was acquired producing a single high-resolution 3D model. It was used to evaluate the conservation status of the painting and to measure the deformations of the ten wooden support. Furthermore, a previous 3D model created in 2002 was also integrated in the study developing a new approach to quantify the panel deformation along time by comparing the two 3D models. These results were presented for the first time at the International Art and Restoration Fair 2018 in Florence.&lt;/p>

In this project, focused on the analysis and study of historical buildings in an endangered state, we worked on the old Badia Camaldolese in Volterra (Pisa). The work was mostly focused on the church of the Saints Giusto and Clemente, now devoid of the roof and much of the structure. To better understand the history of the building and the events that led to its collapse, in this study, starting from a three-dimensional survey of the current state of the church, we created a virtual reconstruction of pre-collapse of the church.&lt;/p>

A complete 3D digitization of the artwork was performed to sample morphology of the pictorial surface at very high-resolution and to support further cross-correlation and analysis of the other data sampled. All the scientific data obtained are being integrated by mapping all the data on the 3D/2D space of the digital representation of the artwork. The aim is to make it easy to consult and view all the data on the Web through an Interactive System, both for scientific and dissemination purposes.&lt;/p>
